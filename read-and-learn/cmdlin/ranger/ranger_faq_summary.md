### Key Points from Ranger FAQ:

1. **Issue: Text Editor Opens a File Named "--"**:
   - **Cause**: Some text editors don't support the `--` flag, which separates filenames from potential flags for security reasons.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Modify `rifle.conf` to remove `--` from editor commands (though this may introduce bugs).
     - Preferably, submit a patch to the text editor to handle the `--` flag correctly.
   - **Location**: Edit lines in `~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf`.

2. **Improving Ranger's Performance**:
   - **Disable Previews**: To speed up Ranger, disable file, directory, and image previews by adding the following lines to `~/.config/ranger/rc.conf` or toggling them at runtime (`zi`, `zP`, `zp`).
     ```bash
     set preview_images false
     set preview_directories false
     set preview_files false
     ```
   - **Avoid Inaccessible Directories**: Ensure no disconnected remote filesystems are directly under `$HOME`; move them to a subdirectory (e.g., `$HOME/remote/target`).

3. **Unintended Characters (Tags) in File/Directory Names**:
   - **Cause**: These are tags, often applied accidentally by pressing `t` (which toggles a tag, defaulting to `*`).
   - **Solution**: Tags are stored in `~/.local/share/ranger/tagged`. To remove a tag, press `ut` or `"` followed by the tag character to untoggle.

These key points address common issues with Ranger's behavior and offer solutions for configuration and performance optimization.
