### Detailed Explanation of Custom Key Bindings in Ranger:

1. **Quickly Edit `rc.conf`**:
   - **Command**: `map X chain shell vim -p ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf %rangerdir/config/rc.conf; source ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf`
   - **Explanation**: This keybinding allows quick access to both the custom and default `rc.conf` files in Vim, opened in split tabs (`-p` flag). After editing, the command automatically reloads (`source`) the modified configuration, so the changes take effect immediately in the current Ranger session.

2. **Smart "cw" for Rename**:
   - **Command**: `map cw eval fm.execute_console("bulkrename") if fm.thisdir.marked_items else fm.open_console("rename " + fm.thisfile.basename)`
   - **Explanation**: This smart rename command checks if multiple files are selected (marked) in the current directory. If so, it triggers the **bulkrename** feature, which allows renaming many files at once. If no files are marked, it defaults to opening the console with the `rename` command, allowing for single-file renaming.

3. **Send Files to Trash**:
   - **Command**:
     - `map DD shell mv -i %s ~/.local/share/Trash/files/ && echo "trashed %s from_dir $(pwd)" >> ~/.config/ranger/trash_history`
     - `map uD shell fileToRestore=$(cat ~/.config/ranger/trash_history ...`
   - **Explanation**: These bindings mimic a file trash system. The `DD` command moves the selected file(s) to the Trash directory, recording their original location in a `trash_history` file. You can restore the last trashed file using `uD`, but note that it places the file in the current directory, not its original location. The `Dh` command shows the trash history for manual restoration of multiple files.

4. **Filter-As-You-Type**:
   - **Command**: `map f console scout -ftsea%space`
   - **Explanation**: This keybinding enables a dynamic file search that filters files as you type, similar to the Unix `find` command. It uses Ranger’s **scout** mode, which helps quickly locate files by their name or metadata (e.g., extensions) in the current directory.

5. **Recursive Search**:
   - **Command**: `map F  chain flat 5 ; console scout -ftsea%space`
   - **Explanation**: This command first flattens the directory structure to a depth of 5 levels using the `flat` command, making all files visible. Then, it performs a recursive file search with real-time filtering (`scout`), much like the previous filter-as-you-type function. The depth can be adjusted (e.g., for unlimited depth, use `flat -1`).

6. **Always Fork When Using "open_with"**:
   - **Command**: `map r chain draw_possible_programs; console -p10 open_with f`
   - **Explanation**: This keybinding opens files with the appropriate external program, and the `f` flag ensures that the program runs in a separate process (fork). This is helpful for opening files with GUI applications, like PDF viewers or image editors, without blocking the terminal.

7. **Open Files in Tmux Splits**:
   - **Commands**:
     - Horizontal split: `map ev shell tmux split-window -h rifle %f`
     - Vertical split: `map es shell tmux split-window -v rifle %f`
     - New window: `map ew shell tmux new-window rifle %f`
   - **Explanation**: These commands integrate **Ranger** with **tmux**, allowing files to be opened in horizontal/vertical splits or new windows within tmux using **rifle**, Ranger’s file opener. This lets you work on files in new panes while keeping your main Ranger instance open.

8. **Toggle File Visibility**:
   - **Script**: `dotify.sh`
   - **Key Binding**: `map <alt>h shell /path/to/dotify.sh %s`
   - **Explanation**: This script toggles the visibility of files by adding or removing the dot (`.`) prefix, which in Unix-like systems hides the file. The keybinding allows you to quickly toggle multiple files between hidden and visible states.

9. **Unmount and Power Off Devices**:
   - **Command**: `map xp shell for selection in %p; do path=$(findmnt -o SOURCE -n $selection); udisksctl unmount -b "$path" && udisksctl power-off -b "$path"; done`
   - **Explanation**: This command unmounts and powers off selected devices (like USB drives) in a loop. It works on mount points or selections of them, ensuring that the devices are properly unmounted and powered off safely. This is particularly useful for safely disconnecting external drives or partitions.
