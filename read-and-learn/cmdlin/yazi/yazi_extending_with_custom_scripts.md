### **Extending Yazi with Custom Scripts and Plugins**

One of the key strengths of Yazi as a Rust-based file manager is its extensibility. Yazi allows users to extend its functionality through custom scripts and plugins, making it highly adaptable for specific workflows, especially for developers and power users who rely on command-line tools for file management. This section will cover how to create custom scripts, integrate external commands, and build or install plugins to extend Yazi’s capabilities.

---

#### **1. Why Extend Yazi?**

Yazi is designed to be lean and fast, but it doesn’t come with every possible feature built-in by default. The real power of Yazi shines when you customize it with scripts or plugins that streamline repetitive tasks, improve productivity, or add new features that align with your specific needs. By extending Yazi, you can:
- Automate file management tasks.
- Integrate Yazi with other tools like Neovim or Tmux.
- Add file previewers, custom commands, or advanced workflows.

---

#### **2. Writing Custom Scripts for Yazi**

Yazi provides the ability to execute custom shell scripts or commands directly within the file manager. By configuring Yazi to run these scripts, you can easily integrate external functionality or automate tasks such as batch renaming files, compressing files, or running code formatters.

##### **Step 1: Create a Shell Script**
You can create a simple shell script to perform any action, such as batch renaming files. Here's an example of a script that renames all `.txt` files in a directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
    mv "$file" "renamed_${file}"
done
```

Save this file as `rename_files.sh` in your preferred scripts directory (e.g., `~/.yazi/scripts/`).

##### **Step 2: Bind the Script to a Key**
To bind this script to a key in Yazi, you can add a custom key binding in your Yazi configuration file (`yazi_config.toml`).

```toml
[keybinds]
"r" = ":!~/.yazi/scripts/rename_files.sh"
```

In this example, pressing the `r` key within Yazi will execute the `rename_files.sh` script, automatically renaming all `.txt` files in the current directory.

##### **Step 3: Test the Script**
Navigate to a directory containing `.txt` files and press `r` to trigger the batch renaming.

---

#### **3. Running External Commands in Yazi**

Yazi allows seamless integration with external command-line tools. You can configure Yazi to run commands like `fd`, `rg`, `fzf`, or even custom-built utilities to extend its functionality. Running external commands inside Yazi is as simple as defining key bindings that call shell commands.

##### **Example: Using `fzf` for Fuzzy File Search**

You can integrate `fzf` (a command-line fuzzy finder) to provide a powerful file search experience directly in Yazi. To bind `fzf` to a key in Yazi, you would add the following to your `yazi_config.toml`:

```toml
[keybinds]
"f" = ":!fzf"
```

This setup allows you to press `f` to trigger `fzf` and instantly start fuzzy-searching for files in the current directory.

##### **Example: Using `rg` for Text Search**

Similarly, you can bind `rg` (Ripgrep) to perform text searches within files from within Yazi:

```toml
[keybinds]
"s" = ":!rg --hidden --ignore-case --no-heading '' | fzf"
```

This command searches all files (including hidden ones) in the current directory for a user-defined string, and the results are piped into `fzf` for interactive filtering.

#### **4. Creating Plugins for Yazi**

Yazi’s plugin system allows you to go beyond simple shell scripts and develop more complex features using Rust, shell scripting, or other programming languages. Plugins can add entirely new capabilities to Yazi, such as:
- Enhanced file preview functionality (e.g., using `bat` for syntax-highlighted previews).
- Git integration to show file statuses, branches, or commit histories.
- Network tools for FTP/SFTP browsing.

##### **Step 1: Write a Plugin Script**

Here’s an example of a simple plugin that shows Git branch information in the Yazi status bar.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# show_branch.sh
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

This plugin retrieves the current Git branch in the repository. You can save this script as `show_branch.sh`.

##### **Step 2: Bind the Plugin to a Key or Event**

To run this plugin as a part of the Yazi status bar, you can modify your `yazi_config.toml` to execute the plugin when a directory is loaded:

```toml
[events]
"directory_loaded" = ":!~/.yazi/scripts/show_branch.sh"
```

This ensures that each time you load a directory, Yazi will execute the script and display the Git branch if you are inside a Git repository.

##### **Step 3: Testing the Plugin**

Navigate into a Git repository in Yazi, and you’ll see the active branch displayed in the status bar after the directory is loaded.

#### **5. Example: Extending Yazi with Neovim Integration**

For developers who frequently use Neovim as their code editor, integrating Yazi with Neovim can streamline the workflow. You can configure Yazi to open files in Neovim seamlessly using custom key bindings.

##### **Step 1: Create the Neovim Launch Script**
Create a script that opens the currently selected file in Neovim.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nvim "$@"
```

Save this file as `open_with_nvim.sh`.

##### **Step 2: Bind the Script to a Key in Yazi**

In `yazi_config.toml`, bind this script to a key (e.g., `n`) for opening files with Neovim:

```toml
[keybinds]
"n" = ":!~/.yazi/scripts/open_with_nvim.sh {file}"
```

Now, pressing `n` in Yazi will open the selected file in Neovim.

---

#### **6. Installing Pre-Built Plugins**

Yazi’s community is growing, and you may find pre-built plugins or scripts shared by other users. Installing these plugins is typically as easy as downloading them and adding appropriate bindings or event hooks in your `yazi_config.toml` file.

- **Step 1: Download Plugin**: Find and download a plugin from a trusted source, such as GitHub or a Yazi community forum.
  
- **Step 2: Place the Plugin**: Place the downloaded plugin or script in the appropriate directory (e.g., `~/.yazi/plugins/`).

- **Step 3: Configure Plugin**: Update your Yazi configuration to activate the plugin, either by adding a key binding or setting up an event trigger.

For example, if you downloaded a plugin for enhanced file previews:

```toml
[keybinds]
"p" = ":!~/.yazi/plugins/preview_file.sh {file}"
```

This binding will run the `preview_file.sh` plugin, which could generate a syntax-highlighted file preview using tools like `bat` or `highlight`.

---

#### **7. Practical Use Case: Automating File Compression in Yazi**

Let’s say you frequently need to compress directories or files. You can create a custom script to zip files and integrate it into Yazi.

##### **Step 1: Create the Compression Script**
Here’s a script to compress a selected file or directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
zip -r "$1.zip" "$1"
```

Save this script as `compress_file.sh`.

##### **Step 2: Bind the Script to a Key in Yazi**
Add the following to your `yazi_config.toml`:

```toml
[keybinds]
"z" = ":!~/.yazi/scripts/compress_file.sh {file}"
```

Now, pressing `z` will compress the currently selected file or directory into a `.zip` archive.

---

### **Conclusion**

Extending Yazi with custom scripts and plugins allows you to tailor the file manager to your specific workflow, automating common tasks and integrating with other powerful tools like Neovim or Tmux. By leveraging Yazi’s ability to bind shell commands to keys and events, you can build an efficient, personalized environment that greatly enhances your productivity.

Whether you're integrating tools like `fzf`, `rg`, or creating more complex plugins, Yazi’s flexibility makes it an ideal choice for users who want full control over their terminal-based file management.
