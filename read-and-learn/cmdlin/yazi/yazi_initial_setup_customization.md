### **3.2 Initial Setup & Customization**

#### **How to Set Up Your Yazi Environment for the First Time**

Setting up Yazi for the first time is straightforward. As a Rust-based tool, it leverages Rust’s package manager, `cargo`, to install. The following steps will guide you through installing Yazi and performing the initial setup.

##### **Step 1: Install Rust (if not already installed)**
Since Yazi is a Rust-based project, the first step is to ensure that Rust is installed on your system. You can do this via the following command:
```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Verify that Rust is correctly installed by running:
```bash
$ rustc --version
```

##### **Step 2: Install Yazi**
Once Rust is installed, you can install Yazi via `cargo` by running the following command:
```bash
$ cargo install yazi
```

This will download and build Yazi on your system.

##### **Step 3: Verify the Installation**
You can verify Yazi is installed correctly by running:
```bash
$ yazi --version
```
This command should print the Yazi version installed on your system, confirming that the installation was successful.

##### **Step 4: Running Yazi for the First Time**
After installation, you can launch Yazi by simply typing `yazi` in the terminal:
```bash
$ yazi
```
Yazi will open the current directory in file browsing mode. You can now begin navigating through files using the default key bindings.

#### **Configuring Default Settings: Key Bindings, Colors, and Themes**

Customization is one of Yazi’s strengths. You can adjust everything from key bindings to themes and colors to suit your preferences. Yazi uses a configuration file (`yazi_config.toml`) where you can define these settings. Below are examples for customizing key bindings, colors, and themes.

##### **Step 1: Locate or Create the Configuration File**
The configuration file is typically located in your home directory (`~/.config/yazi/yazi_config.toml`). If it doesn't exist, you can create it manually.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/yazi
$ touch ~/.config/yazi/yazi_config.toml
```

##### **Step 2: Customizing Key Bindings**

Yazi supports Vim-style navigation (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`), but you can customize it to match your workflow. To change key bindings, add them to the configuration file.

Example: Change the navigation keys to `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`:
```toml
[key_bindings]
move_left = "i"
move_down = "j"
move_up = "k"
move_right = "l"
```

You can also map specific commands, such as opening files in Neovim or copying files to the clipboard.

Example: Open files in Neovim by pressing `e`:
```toml
[key_bindings]
open_in_nvim = "e"
```

##### **Step 3: Customizing Colors and Themes**

Yazi allows you to customize the colors used in the terminal to match your personal preferences or terminal theme. You can configure different colors for directories, files, and selected items.

Example: Set a dark theme with specific colors for directories and files:
```toml
[theme]
background_color = "black"
foreground_color = "white"
directory_color = "blue"
file_color = "green"
selected_item_background = "gray"
```

##### **Step 4: Applying Custom Themes**

Yazi can integrate with terminal themes like Gruvbox, Dracula, or Solarized. You can specify which theme to use in the configuration file, or even create your own theme by specifying different colors.

Example: Apply the Gruvbox theme:
```toml
[theme]
use_gruvbox = true
```

After modifying the `yazi_config.toml` file, you can restart Yazi to apply the changes:
```bash
$ yazi
```

### **3.3 Advanced Configuration**

#### **Extending Yazi with Custom Scripts and Plugins**

One of Yazi's major strengths is its extensibility. You can extend Yazi’s functionalities by integrating custom shell scripts, third-party plugins, or external tools. This makes it a highly customizable tool for power users.

##### **Step 1: Creating Custom Commands**
You can create custom commands that execute shell scripts or chain together several commands to perform more complex tasks. These commands can be triggered directly from Yazi.

Example: A custom script to convert a file to PDF using `pandoc`:
```bash
# pandoc_pdf.sh
#!/bin/bash
pandoc "$1" -o "${1%.md}.pdf"
```

You can then add this custom command to Yazi’s configuration:
```toml
[custom_commands]
convert_to_pdf = "!sh ~/.config/yazi/scripts/pandoc_pdf.sh {file}"
```

Now, when navigating a Markdown file in Yazi, you can run `convert_to_pdf` to convert it into a PDF.

##### **Step 2: Using Plugins for Extra Functionality**

Yazi can be extended by integrating third-party plugins that offer additional functionality, such as previewing images or documents. Although Yazi does not have a dedicated plugin system, it can easily execute external programs to extend its capabilities.

For example, you can use `fzf` for fuzzy finding within Yazi or `bat` for syntax-highlighted file previews.

```bash
:!fzf  # Fuzzy find files from Yazi’s interface
```

You can automate and chain commands by creating scripts or mapping new commands to key bindings.

#### **Integrating Yazi with Other Tools Like Neovim, tmux, and Zellij**

##### **Step 1: Integrating with Neovim**

Yazi can be seamlessly integrated with Neovim, allowing you to open files directly in Neovim from within the file manager. You can create a key binding to open the currently selected file in Neovim.

Example: Open files in Neovim with the key `e`:
```toml
[key_bindings]
open_in_nvim = "e"
```

When browsing files, pressing `e` will open the selected file in Neovim in the current terminal window.

For more advanced workflows, you can use Neovim’s terminal feature to run Yazi in a split pane, allowing you to manage files and edit them side-by-side.

##### **Step 2: Integrating with Tmux**

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that can enhance your productivity by allowing you to split your terminal into multiple panes. You can use Yazi in one pane and Neovim, a terminal, or other tools in another pane, making it a powerful file management solution for developers.

Example: Open Yazi in a tmux split pane:
```bash
# Create a new tmux session and split it horizontally
$ tmux new-session -d -s yazi_session
$ tmux split-window -h
$ tmux send-keys 'yazi' C-m
```

This workflow allows you to manage files in Yazi and execute related commands in another pane, such as running build tools, testing, or Git commands.

##### **Step 3: Integrating with Zellij**

Zellij is another terminal workspace tool that can complement Yazi’s capabilities. Zellij allows you to create terminal layouts with multiple panes, which can help you organize different workflows in a structured way.

Example: Create a Zellij layout with Yazi and Neovim:
```bash
$ zellij action new-tab --name "File Management"
$ zellij action split-right --cwd ~/projects --command "yazi"
$ zellij action split-left --cwd ~/projects --command "nvim"
```

This layout lets you manage files in Yazi while working on code in Neovim in a single terminal workspace, boosting your productivity.

##### **Step 4: Automating Workflows**

By combining Yazi with tools like Neovim, Tmux, and Zellij, you can automate common workflows. For example, when you navigate to a directory in Yazi and open a file in Neovim, you can use Tmux or Zellij to automatically trigger build tools, run tests, or perform other tasks without switching windows.

### Summary

By setting up Yazi and customizing its settings (key bindings, colors, and themes), you can create a file management environment tailored to your workflow. Furthermore, extending Yazi with scripts and integrating it with powerful tools like Neovim, Tmux, and Zellij, unlocks advanced productivity features for developers. Whether you're browsing files, executing shell commands, or integrating external tools, Yazi can be the backbone of a highly efficient command-line setup.
