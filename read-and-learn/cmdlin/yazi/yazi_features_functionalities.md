### **2.1 Core Functionalities**

#### **File Navigation and Manipulation in the Terminal Using Yazi**

Yazi is designed to be a highly efficient and intuitive file manager for the terminal, leveraging the performance and concurrency advantages of Rust. Its core functionalities revolve around basic file navigation, manipulation, and advanced file handling techniques.

##### **File Navigation**  
Navigating files and directories is the primary task of any file manager, and Yazi excels at this by offering a minimalist yet powerful interface. Users can quickly move through directories using arrow keys or custom key bindings.

Key Commands:
- **`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`**: These Vim-style navigation keys are used to move left, down, up, and right within the directory structure, similar to how you navigate in `Ranger`.  
  - `h`: Move up a directory (backward).  
  - `l`: Open a directory or file (forward).  
  - `j` and `k`: Move down and up in the file list.  

Example:
```bash
# To navigate from the current directory to a subdirectory and then open a file:
$ yazi
# Press `l` to enter a directory, use `j` and `k` to move between files.
```

- **Tab Completion**: As you type directory or file names, Yazi offers tab-completion, making it faster to access deeply nested files.

##### **File Manipulation**
Yazi includes essential file manipulation capabilities, such as copying, moving, deleting, and renaming files. These are available through simple, keyboard-centric commands:

- **Copying Files**: To copy a file, use the `yy` command and then navigate to the destination directory and press `p` to paste.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  yy     # Copy the selected file
  p      # Paste the file into the current directory
  ```

- **Moving Files**: To move files, the command `dd` is used for cutting and `p` for pasting.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  dd     # Cut the file from the current location
  p      # Paste the file into the new location
  ```

- **Renaming Files**: Press `cw` (change word) to rename a selected file.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  cw     # Rename a file
  ```

- **Deleting Files**: Use `d` to delete the file under the cursor, with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  d      # Delete the selected file
  ```

##### **Overview of File Browsing, Search, and Filtering Capabilities**

Yazi has advanced browsing and filtering features, which make it easier to handle large directories with numerous files. Instead of visually searching for files, users can employ fuzzy searching and filtering to quickly locate files of interest.

- **File Browsing**: Yazi supports recursive browsing, which means users can browse the file tree structure and see not only the current directory but also subdirectories in a tree-like format. This enhances visibility and makes file traversal faster, especially in deeply nested structures.

  Example:
  ```bash
  # To enable tree-style browsing, type:
  :tree
  ```

- **Search and Filtering**: Using integrated tools like `rg` and `fd`, Yazi can filter files dynamically. For example, if you're looking for all `.md` files in a directory, typing `*.md` in the search bar will show only the markdown files. This feature can be combined with fuzzy finding to refine results further.

  Example:
  ```bash
  :find *.rs   # Show all Rust files in the current directory
  ```

### **2.2 Key Features and Enhancements**

#### **Support for Extensibility and Customization**

Yazi is highly extensible, allowing users to customize the interface and key bindings according to their preferences. It follows the UNIX philosophy of being modular and scriptable, enabling integration with other command-line tools and personal scripts.

##### **Configuration and Custom Key Bindings**
Yazi’s configuration file is a simple, human-readable format (`YAML` or `TOML`), where you can define custom key mappings and behaviors for various commands. Users can extend Yazi by writing their own command sequences or integrating with external scripts.

Example of Custom Key Bindings:
```toml
# yazi_config.toml
[key_bindings]
# Remap 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' for navigation
move_left = "h"
move_down = "j"
move_up = "k"
move_right = "l"

# Custom command to open files with Neovim
open_in_nvim = "e"
```

With the above configuration, pressing `e` in Yazi would open the currently selected file in Neovim, making it a versatile tool for developers.

##### **Custom Commands**
Yazi supports executing custom shell commands directly from within the file manager, enabling you to chain commands, automate tasks, or pipe outputs.

Example:
```bash
# To search for a string in all files and pipe the result to less
:!rg "search_term" | less
```

#### **Integration with Tools like `fd`, `rg`, `fzf` for Optimized Searching and Finding**

One of Yazi’s most powerful enhancements is its seamless integration with external tools like `fd`, `rg` (Ripgrep), and `fzf`. These tools are already widely used in the terminal ecosystem for file finding, searching text within files, and fuzzy searching, respectively.

##### **Using `fd` with Yazi for Fast File Searching**
`fd` is a fast alternative to `find` and is optimized for performance and ease of use. When integrated with Yazi, it can quickly locate files within large directories.

Example:
```bash
:!fd .rs  # List all Rust files in the current directory and subdirectories
```

By using `fd` inside Yazi, you can locate specific file types or patterns in an instant.

##### **Using `rg` (Ripgrep) for Text Search within Files**
Ripgrep (`rg`) is one of the fastest tools for searching text patterns in files. Yazi’s integration with `rg` allows you to search for content within files directly from the file manager interface, with results displayed instantly.

Example:
```bash
:!rg "fn main"   # Search for all occurrences of "fn main" across files
```

In this example, all files containing the string "fn main" will be listed, allowing you to quickly locate the relevant code.

##### **Using `fzf` for Fuzzy File Searching**
`fzf` is a powerful fuzzy finder that helps you locate files or directories without typing the full name. Yazi integrates with `fzf` to offer fast, interactive fuzzy searching, which is particularly helpful when you're unsure of the exact file name.

Example:
```bash
:!fzf
# Typing part of the file name will give you fuzzy matches to choose from
```

Yazi leverages `fzf` to filter through large directories, even allowing you to preview the results before making a selection.

#### **Enhanced Search Capabilities with Combining Tools**
One of the unique aspects of Yazi is that it allows combining these tools (`fd`, `rg`, `fzf`) for even more powerful file search and filtering. For instance, you can use `fd` to locate a file type and `rg` to find text inside those specific files.

Example:
```bash
:!fd .rs | rg "async"   # Find all Rust files and search for "async" inside them
```

In this case, Yazi first uses `fd` to find all `.rs` (Rust) files and then uses `rg` to search for the term `async` within those files, giving you a powerful combination of file and text search.
