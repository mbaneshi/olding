Here are some real-world examples that demonstrate how each advanced `ripgrep` command can be practically applied:

---

### 1. **Context Control**

- **Scenario**: Searching for error logs in a large server log file, you want to see several lines before and after the error message to get the complete context.
  ```bash
  rg -C 5 "ERROR" /var/log/server.log
  ```

- **`-A` and `-B` Example**: Searching for lines with `ERROR` and getting only the 2 lines before and 3 after each match.
  ```bash
  rg -B 2 -A 3 "ERROR" /var/log/server.log
  ```

### 2. **Multithreading and Search Speed**

- **Scenario**: You’re searching for TODO comments across a large repository and want to speed up the search with multiple threads.
  ```bash
  rg --threads 8 "TODO" /path/to/large/repo
  ```

- **Sort Files Example**: Using `--sort-files` to ensure consistent search order when creating reports from a set of source files.
  ```bash
  rg --sort-files "public function" /path/to/codebase
  ```

### 3. **File Filtering**

- **Scenario**: Searching for all instances of `import` statements only within JavaScript files.
  ```bash
  rg -t js "import" /path/to/project
  ```

- **Glob Pattern Example**: Search only `.py` and `.sh` files for environment variables in a multi-language project.
  ```bash
  rg -g "*.py" -g "*.sh" "API_KEY" /path/to/project
  ```

- **Case-Insensitive Globs**: Finding image files with extensions that may be in uppercase or lowercase.
  ```bash
  rg --iglob "*.{jpg,jpeg,png}" "image_alt_text"
  ```

### 4. **Predefined Patterns and Libraries**

- **Scenario**: Searching for `ERROR` messages in compressed `.gz` logs without manually decompressing them first.
  ```bash
  rg --pre "gzip -d" "ERROR" /path/to/logs/*.gz
  ```

### 5. **PCRE2 Regular Expressions**

- **Scenario**: You’re checking for function calls with complex patterns, like matching any `doSomething` or `doSomethingElse`, with lookaheads.
  ```bash
  rg --pcre2 "(?<=do)Something(Else)?" /path/to/code
  ```

### 6. **Negating Patterns**

- **Scenario**: You want to list all code files that don’t contain debug statements, for production-readiness checks.
  ```bash
  rg -v "console.log" /path/to/js/codebase
  ```

- **Log File Example**: Find all log entries that don’t have “INFO” for filtering out non-critical messages.
  ```bash
  rg -v "INFO" /var/log/app.log
  ```

### 7. **Replace Matches with `--replace`**

- **Scenario**: Searching for `foo` in configuration files and replacing it with `bar` to update all instances across the project.
  ```bash
  rg "foo" --replace "bar" /path/to/config
  ```

- **Path Variable Example**: Update a deprecated path variable across scripts to a new location.
  ```bash
  rg "/old/path" --replace "/new/path" /path/to/scripts
  ```

### 8. **Output Customization**

- **Scenario**: Searching through API response logs for errors and outputting the results as JSON for easy integration with a reporting tool.
  ```bash
  rg --json "ERROR" /path/to/logs
  ```

- **Color Example**: Ensuring color is used even when piping output through a terminal, like when using `rg` with `less`.
  ```bash
  rg --color=always "pattern" | less -R
  ```

- **Heading Example**: Searching a large number of files and grouping results by file name for easier reading.
  ```bash
  rg --heading "search_term" /path/to/many/files
  ```

### 9. **File Encoding Control**

- **Scenario**: Searching for UTF-16 encoded Chinese text within data files where encoding varies.
  ```bash
  rg --encoding utf-16 "目标文本" /path/to/encoded/files
  ```

- **Legacy Encoding Example**: Searching for text in files saved in ISO-8859-1 encoding.
  ```bash
  rg --encoding iso-8859-1 "search_string" /path/to/legacy_files
  ```

### 10. **Efficient Recursive and Depth-Controlled Searches**

- **Scenario**: Searching for README files only in the top two directory levels in a complex project folder.
  ```bash
  rg "README" --max-depth 2 /path/to/project
  ```

- **Selective Search Example**: Searching for Python files only within subdirectories up to three levels deep in a library.
  ```bash
  rg -g "*.py" --max-depth 3 "def " /path/to/library
  ```
