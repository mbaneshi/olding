Here's a more detailed list of Wireshark flags and options with descriptions:

1. **-r <file>**:  
   Read packets from a specified capture file instead of capturing live data. This is useful for analyzing previously captured data.

2. **-w <file>**:  
   Write captured packets to a specified file in pcap format. This allows you to save your captured data for later analysis.

3. **-i <interface>**:  
   Specify the network interface to capture packets from. You can list available interfaces using the `-D` option.

4. **-f <capture filter>**:  
   Apply a capture filter (BPF syntax) to limit the packets captured to those matching the filter. This is helpful for reducing the amount of data captured.

5. **-Y <display filter>**:  
   Apply a display filter to limit the packets shown in the UI. This does not affect the packets captured but filters the view in the application.

6. **-k**:  
   Start capturing packets immediately when Wireshark opens. This is useful for quick diagnostics.

7. **-o <key=value>**:  
   Set a specific preference or configuration value before starting. This allows customization of various settings through command-line options.

8. **-t <time format>**:  
   Change the timestamp display format in the capture window. For example, you can use `-t a` for absolute timestamps.

9. **-h**:  
   Display help information about the command-line options. This will show a summary of all available flags and their usage.

10. **-V**:  
   Print version information for Wireshark. This can be useful for ensuring you're using the correct version for your needs.

11. **--disable-gtktest**:  
   Disable GTK testing code, which can be useful for troubleshooting graphical interface issues.

12. **--gui-dbus**:  
   Enable D-Bus for GUI applications, allowing remote control and communication between different processes.

For the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of options, you can always refer to the Wireshark documentation or run `wireshark --help` in your terminal.
