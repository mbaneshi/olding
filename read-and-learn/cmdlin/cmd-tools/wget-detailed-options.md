Hereâ€™s a more detailed list of `wget` flags and options, along with explanations for each:

- `-V, --version`: Displays the version of `wget` installed on your system.

- `-h, --help`: Shows a brief help message with available options and their descriptions.

- `-r, --recursive`: Enables recursive downloading, allowing `wget` to follow links and download files from the specified URL and its linked pages.

- `-np, --no-parent`: Prevents `wget` from ascending to the parent directory when retrieving files. Useful for limiting downloads to a specific directory.

- `-N, --timestamping`: Only downloads files that are newer than the local copy. Useful for updating files without re-downloading everything.

- `-c, --continue`: Continues a partially downloaded file from where it left off. This is especially useful for large files.

- `-P, --directory-prefix=PREFIX`: Specifies the directory where downloaded files will be saved. The default is the current directory.

- `-A, --accept=LIST`: Accepts only files with the specified extensions. For example, `-A jpg,png` will download only JPEG and PNG files.

- `-R, --reject=LIST`: Rejects files with the specified extensions. For example, `-R html` will not download any HTML files.

- `-l, --level=NUMBER`: Sets the maximum recursion depth for downloads. For example, `-l 2` will follow links up to two levels deep.

- `-k, --convert-links`: Converts links in downloaded HTML files so that they point to the local copies instead of the original URLs, enabling offline browsing.

- `-p, --page-requisites`: Downloads all resources needed to properly display a webpage, including images, stylesheets, and scripts.

- `-q, --quiet`: Suppresses all output except for errors, making it suitable for scripting.

- `-O, --output-document=FILE`: Saves the downloaded content to a specified file rather than using the original filename from the URL.

- `--no-check-certificate`: Disables SSL certificate validation, allowing downloads from sites with self-signed or invalid certificates.

- `--limit-rate=RATE`: Limits the download speed to the specified rate (e.g., `--limit-rate=200k` limits to 200 KB/s).

- `--user=USER`: Specifies the username for server authentication.

- `--password=PASS`: Specifies the password for server authentication.

- `--proxy=PROXY`: Specifies the proxy to use for connections.

- `--timeout=SECONDS`: Sets a timeout for network operations. For example, `--timeout=10` will timeout after 10 seconds.

- `-e, --execute=COMMAND`: Allows you to run a command before the download starts, such as setting user agents or configuring options.
