Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can identify devices, services, and operating systems on a network by sending specially crafted packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap is highly versatile, supporting a range of tasks such as port scanning, detecting open services, and even vulnerability detection via NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine).
