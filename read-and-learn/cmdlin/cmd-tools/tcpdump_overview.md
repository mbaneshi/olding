`tcpdump` is a command-line packet analyzer that allows users to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. It is widely used for troubleshooting, monitoring network performance, and diagnosing network-related issues. With `tcpdump`, you can filter packets based on various criteria, such as protocol, port number, and source/destination addresses. The captured data can be saved to a file for further analysis or viewed live in the terminal.

```bash
nvim tcpdump_overview.md
