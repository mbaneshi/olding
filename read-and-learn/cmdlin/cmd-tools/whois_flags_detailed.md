**Short Description:** An elaborated list of flags and options for the `whois` command, including detailed descriptions.

**Content:**

Here’s a more detailed list of common flags and options for the `whois` command:

- `-h` or `--host` **[hostname]**:  
  Specify a different WHOIS server to query instead of the default. Useful for querying non-standard registries.

- `-p` or `--port` **[port]**:  
  Specify a port number for the WHOIS server. The default is usually 43, but some servers may use different ports.

- `-q` or `--quiet`:  
  Suppress non-essential output, only displaying the information directly related to the query. This is helpful for scripts or when only the main information is required.

- `-r` or `--reverse`:  
  Perform a reverse WHOIS lookup on an IP address, allowing you to find domains associated with that IP. This can be useful for identifying all domains hosted on a specific server.

- `-V` or `--version`:  
  Display the version information of the `whois` command you are using. This helps verify if you have the latest version or to check compatibility with certain flags.

- `-a` or `--all`:  
  Retrieve all available information for the domain or IP address. This may include technical contacts, billing contacts, and administrative contacts.

- `-t` or `--type` **[type]**:  
  Specify the type of query to perform. Common types include `domain`, `ip`, or `net` for network-related queries. This can help filter results based on what you’re searching for.

- `-d` or `--domain` **[domain]**:  
  Specify the domain name explicitly. Useful for clarity in scripts or when passing multiple parameters.

- `--help`:  
  Display a help message that lists all available options and flags for the `whois` command.

Note that the availability and functionality of these options may vary depending on the specific implementation of the `whois` command on your operating system.
