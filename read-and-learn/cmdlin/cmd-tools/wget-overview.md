`wget` is a command-line utility to download files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, allowing recursive downloads, converting links in HTML for offline viewing, and downloading files in the background. A basic usage example would be:

```bash
wget https://example.com/file.txt
```

To download recursively, for example, from a website:

```bash
wget --recursive https://example.com/
```

Additionally, it can download files while bypassing certificate checks:

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate https://example.com/file.txt
```

You can also continue a partially downloaded file:

```bash
wget -c https://example.com/largefile.zip
```

This is a versatile tool for retrieving web content from the terminal.

```bash
nvim wget-overview.md
```
