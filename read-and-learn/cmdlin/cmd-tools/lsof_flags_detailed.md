### Description
Below is a more detailed list of the flags and options for the `lsof` command, including their functionalities and examples.

### Detailed `lsof` Flags and Options

- **`-a`**  
  Combines the following conditions with a logical AND. Useful when you want to filter results by multiple criteria.  
  *Example*: `lsof -u username -a -c processname` (lists files opened by a specific user AND a specific process).

- **`-c <command>`**  
  Lists all open files for processes whose command name matches the provided string. You can use a partial name.  
  *Example*: `lsof -c ssh` (shows files opened by any SSH processes).

- **`-d <FD>`**  
  Lists files by specified file descriptor(s). You can specify a single descriptor or a range.  
  *Example*: `lsof -d 3` (shows files associated with file descriptor 3).

- **`-h`**  
  Displays help information, including a brief usage guide and options available for the command.

- **`-i`**  
  Displays all network files (both IPv4 and IPv6), including TCP, UDP, and UNIX domain sockets.  
  *Example*: `lsof -i :80` (shows processes using TCP port 80).

- **`-n`**  
  Prevents the conversion of IP addresses to hostnames, which speeds up the command execution. This is particularly useful when querying a large number of connections.  
  *Example*: `lsof -i -n` (shows network files without resolving hostnames).

- **`-p <PID>`**  
  Lists files opened by a specific process ID (PID).  
  *Example*: `lsof -p 12345` (shows files opened by the process with PID 12345).

- **`-u <username>`**  
  Selects all processes for the specified user. You can specify multiple users with a comma.  
  *Example*: `lsof -u root` (lists files opened by all processes owned by the root user).

- **`+D <directory>`**  
  Recursively lists all files opened in the specified directory and its subdirectories.  
  *Example*: `lsof +D /var/log` (shows all files opened in /var/log and its subdirectories).

- **`+L`**  
  Lists files opened by all processes, even those that are no longer running (but still have open file descriptors).  

- **`-s`**  
  Provides a summary of the types of files opened, giving a brief overview rather than full details. This can help identify common file types in use.  

- **`-V`**  
  Displays version information for `lsof`, including the version number and the release date.  

### Additional Flags (for completeness)

- **`-t`**  
  Outputs only process IDs, which is useful for scripting or when you want to quickly retrieve PIDs.

- **`-r <interval>`**  
  Repeats the command every `interval` seconds. This is useful for monitoring open files dynamically.  
  *Example*: `lsof -i -r 5` (updates the list of open network files every 5 seconds).
