**Short Description:** A brief explanation of the `whois` command, which is used to query domain or IP address information.

**Content:**

The `whois` command is a tool used to query databases that store registered domain names and IP addresses. When you run `whois [domain]` or `whois [IP address]`, it provides information such as:

- Domain registration details (e.g., owner, registration date, expiration date)
- Name servers associated with the domain
- Contact information for the domain registrant

It's commonly used for networking and administrative purposes, allowing users to obtain information about who owns a domain or IP address and how to contact them.
