### Short Description
A brief overview of the `ping` command and its purpose in testing network connectivity.

### Response
The `ping` command is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages to the destination and listens for Echo Response replies. Hereâ€™s a basic rundown of how to use it:

- **Syntax:** 
  ```bash
  ping [options] destination
  ```

- **Example:** 
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```

- **Common Options:**
  - `-c [count]`: Send a specific number of packets.
  - `-i [interval]`: Set the interval between packets.
  - `-t [ttl]`: Set the time to live for packets.

Using `ping` helps diagnose connectivity issues, round-trip time, and packet loss between the source and destination.
