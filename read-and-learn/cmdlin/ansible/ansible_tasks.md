### Tasks in Ansible

In Ansible, **tasks** are the basic unit of work within a playbook. Each task defines a single action that is performed on managed nodes. Tasks leverage **modules** to perform actions such as installing software, copying files, configuring systems, or running commands. They are executed sequentially and are the foundation of Ansible’s automation process.

#### Key Characteristics of Tasks:

- **Modular Execution**: Each task calls a specific Ansible module (e.g., `apt`, `service`, `copy`) to perform a specific function.
- **Idempotent**: Ansible tasks are designed to be **idempotent**, meaning running the same task multiple times will produce the same result without causing side effects. This ensures that tasks do not change the system if it’s already in the desired state.
- **Sequential**: Tasks are executed in the order they are written within a playbook unless conditions (like `when` statements) are used to control their execution flow.

#### Basic Structure of a Task:

A task is defined by a few key components:

- **Name**: An optional, human-readable description of the task. This helps to understand the task when reviewing output or logs.
- **Module**: The specific module being called (e.g., `yum`, `apt`, `service`, `copy`).
- **Arguments**: Key-value pairs that pass parameters to the module to customize its behavior.
- **Other Keywords**: Additional control parameters like `when`, `notify`, or `register`.

Here’s a basic task example:

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
```

In this example:

- The `name` is "Install Nginx" (descriptive text).
- The module is `apt`.
- The module argument is `name: nginx` (specifies the software package) and `state: present` (ensures Nginx is installed).

#### Task Keywords:

In addition to the core task structure, several optional keywords can be used to control the execution and behavior of tasks.

1. **when**: Conditional execution. Tasks are only run if the condition evaluates to true.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Apache only on Debian
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: present
     when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
   ```

2. **notify**: Notifies a handler to run after the task completes successfully.

   ```yaml
   - name: Copy Nginx config
     copy:
       src: nginx.conf
       dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     notify: Restart Nginx
   ```

3. **register**: Stores the output of the task in a variable.

   ```yaml
   - name: Check if a file exists
     stat:
       path: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     register: nginx_config
   ```

4. **tags**: Categorize tasks so they can be selectively run.
   ```yaml
   - name: Install Git
     apt:
       name: git
       state: present
     tags:
       - software
       - installation
   ```

#### Task Execution:

- **Failure Handling**: If a task fails, the playbook stops unless `ignore_errors: true` is specified, or the `failed_when` condition is used to customize failure handling.
- **Task Results**: After execution, tasks provide feedback on whether any changes were made to the system. This output can be used to trigger handlers or conditionally execute subsequent tasks.

Tasks make up the backbone of Ansible's automation, dictating what specific actions need to be performed on the remote systems.

```bash
nvim ansible_tasks.md
```
