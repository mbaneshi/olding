### Modules in Ansible

Ansible modules are the building blocks that make automation possible in Ansible. They are essentially scripts or executables that perform specific tasks on managed nodes. Each task in a playbook calls a module, and Ansible includes hundreds of built-in modules for managing various systems and tasks such as installing software, managing files, and handling services. These modules make Ansible highly extensible and flexible.

#### Purpose of Modules:

Modules abstract the low-level details of the operations you want to perform. Instead of writing complex scripts to configure systems or deploy applications, you can use modules that perform these tasks in a standardized and consistent way. Modules are designed to ensure idempotency, meaning that running the same module multiple times will not change the system unless necessary.

#### Types of Modules:

1. **Core Modules**: These are included with every Ansible installation and are maintained as part of the official Ansible project. They cover a wide range of tasks like file manipulation, package management, network configuration, etc.
2. **Custom Modules**: Ansible allows users to write their own modules to handle specific tasks that aren’t covered by core modules. These can be written in any language that the target system can execute (e.g., Python, Bash, PowerShell).

3. **Third-party Modules**: Users and communities can share modules that are not part of Ansible’s core collection but can be downloaded and used in playbooks.

#### Commonly Used Modules:

- **Package Management**:

  - `apt` for managing packages on Debian-based systems.
  - `yum` for Red Hat-based systems.
  - `pip` for managing Python packages.

- **Service Management**:

  - `service` for starting, stopping, or restarting services.
  - `systemd` for managing services on systemd-based systems.

- **File Manipulation**:

  - `copy` for copying files from a local machine to a remote node.
  - `file` for managing file permissions, ownership, and creating directories.

- **User Management**:

  - `user` for managing users on a system.
  - `group` for managing groups.

- **Cloud Infrastructure**:
  - Modules for AWS (e.g., `ec2`, `s3`), Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers allow Ansible to manage cloud resources.

#### Example of Using a Module:

Here’s an example where the `apt` module is used to install `nginx` on a Debian-based system.

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
```

In this example, the `apt` module ensures that the `nginx` package is installed. If `nginx` is already installed, the task will not run again, thanks to the idempotency of modules.

#### How Modules Work:

When a playbook is executed, each task in the playbook calls a specific module. The module is transferred to the managed node (if needed), and the module’s command or script is executed. After execution, the module sends the result (whether the task was successful, failed, or made changes) back to Ansible.

Modules run on the remote machines by default, but some modules (called **action plugins**) are run locally on the Ansible control machine (like `include_vars` or `set_fact`).

#### Module Parameters:

Modules usually require parameters to define how they will perform the task. For instance, in the example of the `apt` module, the parameters are `name`, which defines the package to install, and `state`, which specifies the desired status of the package (e.g., `present`, `latest`, `absent`).

Here’s a breakdown:

- **name**: Specifies the name of the package (`nginx` in this case).
- **state**: Defines the desired state. For package modules like `apt`, common states include:
  - `present`: Ensures the package is installed.
  - `latest`: Ensures the latest version is installed.
  - `absent`: Ensures the package is uninstalled.

#### Custom Modules:

If the built-in modules don’t cover a specific use case, you can create custom modules. A simple custom module can be written in Python like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule

def run_module():
    module_args = dict(
        message=dict(type='str', required=True),
        state=dict(type='str', choices=['present', 'absent'], default='present')
    )

    result = dict(
        changed=False,
        message=''
    )

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=module_args,
        supports_check_mode=True
    )

    if module.params['state'] == 'present':
        result['message'] = "Message is present: " + module.params['message']
    else:
        result['message'] = "Message is absent"

    module.exit_json(**result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_module()
```

You can then use this custom module in your playbook like any other module.

#### Advantages of Using Modules:

1. **Simplified Task Automation**: Modules allow users to focus on what they want to achieve without worrying about how it is implemented.
2. **Consistency**: Modules ensure that tasks are executed in a consistent manner across various systems, reducing human error and improving reliability.

3. **Idempotency**: Most modules are designed to be idempotent, ensuring that no unnecessary changes are made to the system when the playbook is rerun.

4. **Extensibility**: The ability to write custom modules makes Ansible adaptable to almost any use case.

Ansible’s extensive module library makes it an extremely versatile tool for automating a wide variety of tasks across different environments and platforms.

```bash
nvim ansible_modules.md
```
