**Short Description**: Exploring Neovim porting efforts to Rust  
**Response Stats**: 31 lines, 1,268 characters  

While Neovim isn’t entirely written in Rust, there are **active efforts to integrate Rust** into Neovim, mostly in the form of **Rust plugins** and **Rust-based libraries** that extend Neovim’s functionality. 

### Current Efforts and Projects

1. **Neovim Client Libraries in Rust**:
   - **`nvim-rs`**: A popular Rust client library that interacts with Neovim via the RPC API. It’s useful for building Rust-based Neovim plugins or external tooling that can control and communicate with Neovim instances.
   - **`neovim-lib`**: Another Rust library for Neovim that simplifies plugin development in Rust and allows external programs to interact with Neovim sessions.

2. **Rust-based Neovim Plugins**:
   - **Tree-sitter**: Rust is central to **nvim-treesitter** for syntax highlighting, leveraging Tree-sitter’s Rust API for parsing. This integrates Rust directly into Neovim’s runtime.
   - **Rust LSP and Formatter Plugins**: There are also several formatters, linters, and LSP servers built in Rust that run within Neovim’s ecosystem, though not within Neovim itself.

3. **Potential for Core Porting**:
   - While there's no full-scale port of Neovim to Rust, the ongoing Lua refactoring could lay groundwork for future projects. However, a full port would require extensive work on re-implementing core C APIs and UI integration in Rust.

So, although Neovim itself isn't moving to Rust, **the ecosystem increasingly uses Rust**, with Rust tools and plugins integrating closely into its environment.
