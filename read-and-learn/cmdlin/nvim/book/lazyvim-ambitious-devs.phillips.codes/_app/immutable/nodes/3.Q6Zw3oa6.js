			ethos of being hard to learn and harder to configure.</p> <p style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-7)" class="svelte-18zedkw">No More!</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">The <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim</a> distribution has crafted a delightful and powerful
			out-of-the-box experience that is on par with any modern IDE. Configuration is either unnecessary
			or simple.</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">That takes care of the &quot;configuration&quot; problem, but in order to use LazyVim effectively, you
			must first know how to use LazyVim.</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">This book was written for developers who want to ramp up on modal editing with Neovim. It is
			approachable and digestible, but most of all, it is comprehensive. It collects tips and tricks
			gained from over two decades of using Vim, and is written with the gentle humour Dusty
			Phillips brings to all his work.</p></section> <section class="content svelte-18zedkw"><h2 class="svelte-18zedkw">About the Author</h2> <img class="author svelte-18zedkw" src="/images/dusty.jpg" alt="Dusty Phillips"/> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">Dusty Phillips is a software developer and author. His most popular book, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-object-oriented-programming-fourth-edition/">Python Object Oriented Programming</a> is now in its 4th edition, though Dusty is no longer a fan of OOP!</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">Dusty began coding in QBasic, Visual Basic, and Java as a teenager, but settled on a career in
			Python long before it became popular. He was the first person to write a book on Python 3 and
			was part of the team instrumental in bringing Python 3 to Instagram and Facebook. More
			recently, he enjoys experimenting with esoteric programming languages, many articles on which
			can be found on his <a href="https://dusty.phillips.codes/">blog</a>.</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">Dusty has worked for a wide variety of companies, from two person startups to the world&#39;s
			largest social network (and the world&#39;s largest government), and companies of all sizes in
			between.</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">Dusty lives with his wife and 75 acres of trees in New Brunswick, Canada. The two of them
			recently co-founded <a href="https://www.fablehenge.com/">Fablehenge</a>, a platform for
			novelists to organize and write their stories.</p></section> <section class="content svelte-18zedkw"><h2 class="svelte-18zedkw">Support</h2> <p class="svelte-18zedkw"><iconify-icon icon="fa-6:brands-patreon"></iconify-icon>
			Dusty welcomes your <a href="/course/purchase/">support</a> on various platforms, or by purchasing
			the ebook or print version of LazyVim for Ambitious Developers. There is a textbook&#39;s worth of
			content here, but please value it as you see fit.</p></section> <section class="content svelte-18zedkw"><h2 class="svelte-18zedkw">Update Cadence</h2> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">When substantial updates are made to the book, I upload them to Patreon first, and they hit
			the website a minimum of 2 weeks later.</p> <p class="svelte-18zedkw">The purchased ebooks and print book are updated less frequence. When LazyVim receives a change
			major enough to warrant a new edition of the book, I will obtain new ISBNs and publish the
			book as a Second Edition.</p></section> <div class="cta svelte-18zedkw"><a class="btn cta svelte-18zedkw" href="/course">Read Online (Free)</a> <a class="btn cta svelte-18zedkw" href="/course/purchase/">Purchase or Support</a></div>`,c,o,w="Â© 2024 Dusty Phillips";return{c(){t=d("meta"),n=d("meta"),l=v(),s=d("main"),s.innerHTML=m,c=v(),o=d("footer"),o.textContent=w,this.h()},l(e){const a=P("svelte-1es1i95",document.head);t=h(a,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),n=h(a,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),a.forEach(i),l=f(e),s=h(e,"MAIN",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),k(s)!=="svelte-1u117z7"&&(s.innerHTML=m),c=f(e),o=h(e,"FOOTER",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),k(o)!=="svelte-1i5l0ii"&&(o.textContent=w),this.h()},h(){document.title="LazyVim for Ambitious Developers",r(t,"name","description"),r(t,"content","A comprehensive tutorial on the LazyVim distribution for Neovim, ideal for developers who want to reach the next level of productivity."),r(n,"name","keywords"),r(n,"content","vim, lazy, lazyvim, neovim, tutorial, course, book, training, ambitious, developers, programming, editing, modal editing"),r(s,"class","svelte-18zedkw"),r(o,"class","svelte-18zedkw")},m(e,a){g(document.head,t),g(document.head,n),p(e,l,a),p(e,s,a),p(e,c,a),p(e,o,a)},p:u,i:u,o:u,d(e){e&&(i(l),i(s),i(c),i(o)),i(t),i(n)}}}class T extends z{constructor(t){super(),D(this,t,null,V,b,{})}}export{T as component};
