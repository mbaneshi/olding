Since you're using **LazyVim** for your Neovim setup, adjusting your LSP configuration to optimize resource usage and load servers only when needed can be done by modifying the LSP setup provided by LazyVim.

### LazyVim LSP Configuration Overview

LazyVim uses **`mason.nvim`** and **`lspconfig`** to manage LSP servers. By default, LazyVim is configured to automatically ensure certain LSP servers are installed and started for their respective filetypes.

### Steps to Adjust LSP Configurations in LazyVim

1. **Check `mason-lspconfig` settings**: LazyVim might be auto-installing and auto-starting several LSP servers. You can control which servers are installed and started through the `mason-lspconfig` settings.

2. **Update your `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` file**: In your LazyVim config directory (likely `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins`), modify the LSP settings in `lsp.lua` to control which servers are automatically loaded and fine-tune the autostart behavior for each LSP.

Here’s how you can make adjustments:

### 1. Disable Unused LSP Servers

If there are LSP servers you don’t need, you can prevent them from being installed or started by customizing your `lsp.lua` file like this:

```lua
return {
  -- Make sure 'mason-lspconfig' is installed and set up
  {
    "williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim",
    opts = {
      -- List of LSP servers to automatically install
      ensure_installed = {
        "dockerls",  -- Docker LSP
        "pyright",   -- Python LSP
        "clangd",    -- C/C++ LSP
        "jsonls",    -- JSON LSP
        -- Add the LSPs you need here and remove the ones you don't
      },
    },
  },
  -- Modify the default 'lspconfig' setup
  {
    "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
    opts = {
      servers = {
        -- Enable specific LSPs
        dockerls = {
          autostart = true,
          -- Add filetype-specific settings or capabilities here
        },
        pyright = {
          autostart = true,
          -- Other settings for Python's LSP
        },
        -- Add other servers you need, or adjust specific ones
        -- Disable or fine-tune any unnecessary LSP servers here
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### 2. Lazy Load LSPs by Filetype

To optimize performance, load the LSP server **only for specific filetypes**. For instance, you may not need the `clangd` server for every project, only when working with C/C++ files.

You can specify filetypes in your `lsp.lua` file like this:

```lua
require('lspconfig').clangd.setup({
  filetypes = { "c", "cpp", "objc", "objcpp" },  -- Only activate for C/C++ files
  autostart = true,  -- Set autostart if needed
})
```

### 3. Disable Unnecessary LSP Autostart

If certain LSP servers are starting automatically but you rarely use them, you can disable autostart. This can be useful for servers like `prismals`, which you might not need in every session.

```lua
require('lspconfig').prismals.setup({
  autostart = false,  -- Disable autostart, load manually if needed
})
```

### 4. Fine-Tune `mason` and `mason-lspconfig`

LazyVim automatically uses `mason` to manage LSP installations. You can also update your `mason` settings to prevent certain servers from being installed if you don't use them.

In your `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` file, under the **`mason-lspconfig`** section, only list the LSPs you actively use. For example:

```lua
{
  "williamboman/mason.nvim",
  opts = {
    ensure_installed = { "dockerls", "pyright", "jsonls" },  -- Only these LSPs will be installed
  },
},
```

### 5. Use Conditional Loading for Rarely Used LSPs

For LSPs you use infrequently, consider manually loading them when required:

```lua
-- Load Prismal only when needed
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
  pattern = { "prisma" },
  callback = function()
    require('lspconfig').prismals.setup({})
  end,
})
```

### Example Config for LazyVim LSP Optimization

Here's a full example of how your **`lua/plugins/lsp.lua`** might look with optimizations:

```lua
return {
  {
    "williamboman/mason.nvim",
    opts = {
      ensure_installed = { "dockerls", "pyright", "clangd", "jsonls" },  -- Only install the servers you need
    },
  },
  {
    "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
    opts = {
      servers = {
        dockerls = { autostart = true },
        pyright = { autostart = true },
        clangd = {
          autostart = false,  -- Only start clangd when working with C/C++ files
          filetypes = { "c", "cpp" },
        },
        prismals = { autostart = false },  -- Disable autostart for Prisma
        -- Add more LSP server configurations here
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Conclusion

By adjusting your LazyVim configuration to load only the necessary LSPs and using filetype-specific settings, you can significantly improve performance and resource usage. Review the LSP servers you're using, disable the unnecessary ones, and ensure autostart is only applied where needed.
