### 4. **Pane Splitting**

WezTerm’s pane splitting feature allows you to split your terminal window into multiple sections (or panes), letting you run different shell instances side by side. You can split panes both **horizontally** and **vertically**, similar to how window managers like `i3` or terminal multiplexers like `tmux` work.

#### **How Pane Splitting Works in WezTerm:**

In WezTerm, panes allow you to view multiple terminal sessions in a single tab. For example, you might be running a web server in one pane and editing code or monitoring logs in another, all without switching tabs or windows.

#### **Hands-on Example:**

Let’s say you’re working on a project and need to run both your development server and a test watcher simultaneously while editing files. Instead of switching between tabs or opening a new terminal window, you can split your terminal into panes.

1. **Open WezTerm**.
2. **Split a Pane Vertically** (one pane above the other):

   - Use the following key binding:

     ```bash
     Ctrl+Shift+e  # Split pane vertically
     ```

   - Now, you will have two terminal panes stacked on top of each other.

3. **Split a Pane Horizontally** (side by side):

   - Use this key binding:

     ```bash
     Ctrl+Shift+d  # Split pane horizontally
     ```

   - You will have two panes next to each other. You can continue splitting further if needed.

4. **Navigating Between Panes**:
   After splitting your terminal into multiple panes, you can move between them using:

   ```bash
   Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right/Up/Down  # Navigate between panes
   ```

5. **Resizing Panes**:
   - To resize the panes, press:

     ```bash
     Alt+Shift+ArrowKeys  # Resize the current pane
     ```

#### **Customizing Pane Behavior with Lua**

You can also configure pane-related behaviors in your WezTerm Lua configuration file:

**Example Lua Config**:

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  -- Key bindings for splitting panes
  keys = {
    {key="e", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitVertical={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},
    {key="d", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitHorizontal={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},
  }
}
```

This snippet sets up custom key bindings to manage pane splitting.

#### **Benefits of Pane Splitting**

- **Efficient Multitasking**: View and interact with multiple terminal sessions without switching tabs.
- **Flexible Layout**: Split panes either horizontally or vertically to suit your workspace and workflow.

```bash
nvim wezterm_pane_splitting.md
```
