### 2. **Tab and Pane Behavior in WezTerm: A Comprehensive Guide**

WezTerm excels at managing multiple tabs and panes within a single terminal window, allowing users to customize how they interact with their terminal sessions. Leveraging **Lua scripting**, users can fine-tune the behavior of tabs and panes to suit their specific workflows and preferences. This section delves into the various aspects of tab and pane management in WezTerm.

#### 2.1 **Understanding Tabs and Panes**

- **Tabs** are like separate workspaces within the terminal. Each tab can host a distinct shell session or command.
- **Panes** refer to the subdivisions of a tab, allowing users to split their view into multiple terminal instances. Panes can be arranged both horizontally and vertically.

### 2.2 **Basic Tab Management**

Tabs in WezTerm can be easily managed with Lua scripts. You can create, close, and switch between tabs using predefined actions.

#### Example: Creating and Closing Tabs

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  keys = {
    -- Open a new tab
    {key="t", mods="CTRL", action=wezterm.action{SpawnTab="CurrentPaneDomain"}},

    -- Close the current tab
    {key="w", mods="CTRL", action=wezterm.action{CloseCurrentTab={confirm=true}}},

    -- Switch to the next tab
    {key="RightArrow", mods="CTRL", action=wezterm.action{ActivateTabRelative=1}},

    -- Switch to the previous tab
    {key="LeftArrow", mods="CTRL", action=wezterm.action{ActivateTabRelative=-1}},
  }
}
```

In this script:

- `Ctrl+t` creates a new tab.
- `Ctrl+w` closes the current tab with confirmation.
- `Ctrl+RightArrow` and `Ctrl+LeftArrow` navigate between tabs.

### 2.3 **Customizing Tab Behavior**

You can also configure how new tabs behave when opened. For example, you can set a specific command or program to run automatically when a new tab is created.

#### Example: Running a Command in a New Tab

```lua
return {
  default_prog = {"/bin/zsh"},  -- Sets the default shell for new tabs
}
```

With this configuration, every new tab will open a Zsh shell.

### 2.4 **Pane Management**

WezTerm allows users to split tabs into multiple panes, providing the ability to work on several tasks concurrently. Users can split panes horizontally or vertically.

#### Example: Splitting Panes

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Split the current pane horizontally
    {key="d", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitHorizontal={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},

    -- Split the current pane vertically
    {key="d", mods="CTRL|ALT", action=wezterm.action{SplitVertical={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},
  }
}
```

Here, `Ctrl+Shift+d` splits the current pane horizontally, while `Ctrl+Alt+d` splits it vertically.

### 2.5 **Resizing Panes**

Resizing panes can be accomplished with additional key bindings that allow users to adjust pane sizes without needing to rely on the mouse.

#### Example: Resizing Panes

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Resize pane to the left
    {key="LeftArrow", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{AdjustPaneSize={"Left", 1}}},

    -- Resize pane to the right
    {key="RightArrow", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{AdjustPaneSize={"Right", 1}}},

    -- Resize pane upward
    {key="UpArrow", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{AdjustPaneSize={"Up", 1}}},

    -- Resize pane downward
    {key="DownArrow", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{AdjustPaneSize={"Down", 1}}},
  }
}
```

These bindings allow for quick resizing of the active pane, enhancing the usability of terminal layouts.

### 2.6 **Switching Between Panes**

WezTerm allows easy navigation between multiple panes. Users can cycle through panes using key bindings.

#### Example: Switching Between Panes

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Switch to the next pane
    {key="Tab", mods="CTRL", action=wezterm.action{ActivatePaneDirection="Right"}},

    -- Switch to the previous pane
    {key="Tab", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{ActivatePaneDirection="Left"}},
  }
}
```

This setup allows users to switch between panes using the `Ctrl+Tab` combination.

### 2.7 **Configuring Default Pane Layouts**

WezTerm supports defining default layouts for newly created panes. This feature allows users to customize their terminal setup based on their preferences or workflows.

#### Example: Default Pane Layout

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  default_startup_tabs = {  -- Define the startup tabs and their layouts
    {
      tabs = {
        {
          title = "Main",
          shell = "/bin/zsh",
        },
        {
          title = "Logs",
          shell = "/bin/tail -f /var/log/syslog",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

In this example, two tabs are opened by default, one for the main shell and another for monitoring logs.

### 2.8 **Handling Pane Persistence**

WezTerm allows users to configure how terminal sessions behave when closed or interrupted. For example, users can choose to keep panes open or have them automatically close after completion.

#### Example: Pane Persistence

```lua
return {
  exit_behavior = "Close",  -- Defines how the terminal behaves on exit
  inactive_pane = {
    -- Define how to handle inactive panes
    close = true,
  },
}
```

Here, the terminal will close inactive panes automatically when the shell completes.

### 2.9 **Event Handling for Tabs and Panes**

WezTerm allows you to hook into its event system to trigger scripts based on tab or pane activities. This can be beneficial for logging or executing commands under specific circumstances.

#### Example: Custom Actions on Pane Activation

```lua
wezterm.on("pane-activated", function(window, pane)
  local title = pane:get_title()  -- Get the title of the activated pane
  window:set_title("Working in: " .. title)  -- Change the window title
end)
```

In this example, the terminal window title updates to reflect the active paneâ€™s title when a pane is activated.

### Conclusion on Tab and Pane Behavior

The customization capabilities for tabs and panes in WezTerm through Lua scripting significantly enhance user productivity and streamline workflows. By tailoring key bindings, defining default layouts, managing pane sizes, and leveraging events, users can create a terminal environment that best suits their specific needs. This flexibility, combined with the power of Lua, makes WezTerm a robust tool for handling complex terminal tasks efficiently.
