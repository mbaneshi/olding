### WezTerm's Customization through Lua Scripting: A Deep Dive

WezTerm is a modern terminal emulator that is particularly noted for its flexibility and extensive configurability through **Lua scripting**. Lua is a powerful yet lightweight, embeddable scripting language designed for fast execution and ease of use. Its integration into WezTerm allows users to go beyond basic configuration, unlocking deep control over how the terminal behaves, looks, and interacts with the system.

Letâ€™s explore in detail how Lua scripting enhances the customization potential of WezTerm:

### 1. **Key Bindings Customization**

WezTerm allows users to define **custom key bindings** using Lua. This means that instead of being restricted to the default key mappings, you can define your own keyboard shortcuts for almost any action within the terminal.

#### Example:

You can create custom key bindings to switch between panes, tabs, or even trigger custom actions. For instance, you might bind a key to open a new tab in a specific working directory or switch between active panes.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  keys = {
    -- Bind 'Ctrl-n' to open a new tab with your desired command
    {key="n", mods="CTRL", action=wezterm.action{SpawnTab="CurrentPaneDomain"}},

    -- Bind 'Ctrl-Shift-x' to close the current pane
    {key="x", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{CloseCurrentPane={confirm=false}}},
  },
}
```

Here, `SpawnTab` opens a new tab, and `CloseCurrentPane` closes the active pane.

### 2. **Tab and Pane Behavior**

Lua scripting gives you fine control over how tabs and panes behave. WezTerm supports a **multiplexed terminal** setup, allowing users to open multiple panes and tabs within a single window. With Lua, you can script this behavior, ensuring that tabs and panes behave according to your specific workflow.

#### Pane Layouts:

You can define pane splits in various configurations using Lua. For instance, you might want panes to open in a particular direction or have a predefined layout when you open a new session.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  keys = {
    -- Split horizontally
    {key="|", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitHorizontal={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},

    -- Split vertically
    {key="-", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitVertical={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},
  }
}
```

### 3. **Look and Feel Customization (Colors, Fonts, and Opacity)**

With Lua scripting, **every visual aspect** of WezTerm can be customized. This includes not only color schemes but also fonts, transparency (opacity), cursor styles, and more. By defining these settings in Lua, you have granular control over how your terminal appears.

#### Color Schemes:

You can either choose from the available predefined color schemes or create your own custom ones using Lua.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  colors = {
    foreground = "#c0c0c0",
    background = "#1e1e1e",
    cursor_bg = "#ffcc00",
    cursor_border = "#ffcc00",
    selection_bg = "#666666",
    selection_fg = "#ffffff",
  },
  font = wezterm.font("JetBrains Mono"),
  font_size = 12.0,
  window_background_opacity = 0.95,  -- Set window opacity
}
```

In this script:

- The foreground and background colors are customized.
- A custom font ("JetBrains Mono") is used with a defined size.
- Opacity is set to 95% for a semi-transparent window.

### 4. **Custom Prompts and Overlays**

WezTerm also supports **dynamic prompts** or overlays that can be implemented using Lua scripting. This allows users to build interactive prompts within their terminal that can gather user input or display additional information based on certain triggers.

#### Example:

You could build a custom prompt that asks the user which project to work on upon opening a new tab or window.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

wezterm.on("open-project", function(window, pane)
  window:show_message_box("Which project would you like to open?", function(response)
    if response == "Project A" then
      pane:send_text("cd ~/projects/ProjectA\n")
    elseif response == "Project B" then
      pane:send_text("cd ~/projects/ProjectB\n")
    end
  end)
end)
```

In this example, the user is presented with a choice of projects, and the terminal automatically navigates to the correct directory based on the user's input.

### 5. **Automating Tasks**

Lua scripting in WezTerm opens up possibilities for **automating repetitive tasks** such as managing terminal sessions, connecting to remote servers, or launching specific applications. This can save time and improve productivity.

#### Example:

Imagine automating a task where you regularly connect to a specific remote server and start a development environment.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  -- Automatically connect to a remote server on startup
  default_prog = {"/usr/bin/ssh", "user@myserver.com"},

  -- Run a script after connecting
  wezterm.on("trigger-session-setup", function()
    wezterm:exec({"/usr/bin/start-dev-environment.sh"})
  end),
}
```

This script connects to a remote server and automatically runs a shell script to set up the development environment when the session starts.

### 6. **Hooking into WezTerm's Event System**

WezTerm has an **event system** that allows users to trigger scripts based on system or user actions, such as window resize, tab switch, pane focus, etc. By hooking into these events, you can create customized workflows or automate actions that react to these changes.

#### Example:

You can set up hooks for actions such as resizing the terminal window and automatically adjusting the font size.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

wezterm.on("window-resized", function(window, pane)
  local new_size = window:get_dimensions()
  if new_size.pixel_width < 800 then
    window:set_config_overrides({
      font_size = 10,
    })
  else
    window:set_config_overrides({
      font_size = 14,
    })
  end
end)

return {}
```

In this script, the font size is automatically adjusted based on the window size.

### Conclusion

The use of Lua scripting in WezTerm makes it an exceptionally **customizable** terminal emulator. Whether you're adjusting key bindings, modifying the look and feel, creating custom prompts, automating workflows, or hooking into system events, Lua gives you the power to deeply configure and extend the terminal's functionality. By leveraging the full potential of Lua, you can tailor WezTerm to fit your personal or organizational needs, making it a powerful tool in any development environment.
