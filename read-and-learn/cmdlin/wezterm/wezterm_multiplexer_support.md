### 1. **Multiplexer Support**:

WezTerm integrates terminal multiplexing directly, similar to standalone tools like `tmux`. Terminal multiplexing allows you to create, manage, and switch between multiple terminal sessions within the same window without needing a separate multiplexer tool. This feature is particularly useful for running and managing multiple processes or tasks within a single terminal window.

#### **How Multiplexer Works in WezTerm:**

When using WezTerm, multiplexing is done through **tabs** and **panes**. You can open multiple terminal sessions (often running different shell instances) within one terminal window and switch between them. You can even split panes within a tab, which adds flexibility to how you manage your terminal space.

#### **Hands-on Example:**

Suppose you want to work on different tasks in separate sessions (for example, running a development server, monitoring logs, and writing code). Hereâ€™s how to set up terminal multiplexing with WezTerm:

1. **Open WezTerm.**
2. To create a new **tab** (session) for each task:
   - Use the key binding:
     ```bash
     Ctrl+Shift+t  # Open a new tab
     ```
     Now, you have a new session running in a separate tab.
3. **Switching between tabs** is easy:
   - Navigate to the next tab:
     ```bash
     Ctrl+Shift+Tab
     ```
   - Or switch directly using `Ctrl+<tab_number>`.
4. If you want to see multiple sessions within the same window, you can split the terminal into panes.

#### **Example: Creating Panes (within the same tab):**

In one tab, you can create several panes for parallel work:

1. **Vertically split the pane** (one pane above the other):
   ```bash
   Ctrl+Shift+e  # Split pane vertically
   ```
2. **Horizontally split the pane** (one pane next to another):
   ```bash
   Ctrl+Shift+d  # Split pane horizontally
   ```

#### **Customizing Multiplexer Key Bindings with Lua**:

You can configure or even change the default key bindings for managing tabs and panes in the WezTerm configuration file using Lua:

**Example Lua Config:**

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  keys = {
    -- Create new tab
    {key="t", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SpawnTab="CurrentPaneDomain"}},

    -- Split pane vertically
    {key="e", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitVertical={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},

    -- Split pane horizontally
    {key="d", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SplitHorizontal={domain="CurrentPaneDomain"}}},
  }
}
```

By adding this to your configuration file, you can set custom shortcuts or add extra functionality to your multiplexer setup.

### **Benefits:**

- **Workflow Efficiency**: You can run multiple sessions simultaneously without needing a separate tool like `tmux`.
- **Built-in Integration**: Unlike external multiplexers, WezTerm's integration is seamless and doesn't require additional setup or learning, reducing overhead.
