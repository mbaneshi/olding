WezTerm offers several modern features that make it a versatile terminal emulator:

1. **Multiplexer Support**: WezTerm supports terminal multiplexing, allowing you to create multiple terminal sessions within a single window. This can be compared to tools like tmux, but it's integrated directly into WezTerm.

2. **Tab Management**: It provides built-in tab management, letting you open multiple sessions in separate tabs. You can navigate between tabs easily, organize workflows, and manage terminal instances more efficiently.

3. **Font Ligature Rendering**: WezTerm supports font ligatures, which improve code readability by rendering special characters (like `!=`, `<=`) as combined symbols, making them visually cleaner and easier to understand.

4. **Pane Splitting**: You can split your terminal into multiple panes, both vertically and horizontally. This is useful for multitasking, letting you view and interact with several terminal sessions at once, similar to tiling window managers.

5. **Dynamic Reloading of Configuration Files**: WezTerm allows dynamic reloading of its Lua configuration files without needing to restart the terminal, so changes can be applied on the fly, which is useful for quickly iterating on configurations.

6. **SSH Integration**: It has SSH client capabilities built-in, allowing you to connect to remote machines and manage multiple SSH sessions, with easy switching between local and remote terminals.
