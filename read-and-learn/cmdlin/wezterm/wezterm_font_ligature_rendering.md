### 3. **Font Ligature Rendering**

WezTerm supports **font ligatures**, a feature that improves the readability of code and text. Ligatures are special combinations of characters that are automatically replaced with a single visually appealing glyph when certain character sequences appear (like `!=`, `->`, or `===`), often seen in programming fonts like Fira Code.

#### **How Font Ligatures Work in WezTerm:**

In programming, certain combinations of characters can be combined into a single symbol, improving the aesthetics of code and making it more understandable at a glance. Instead of displaying two separate characters like `!=`, it will render it as `≠`.

WezTerm supports these ligatures out of the box if you use a font that has them enabled. Some popular fonts include **Fira Code**, **Cascadia Code**, and **JetBrains Mono**.

#### **Hands-on Example:**

Let’s assume you are writing some Python or JavaScript code in WezTerm, and you want to make the `!==` operator visually appear as `≠`. To enable this:

1. **Select a Ligature-Supporting Font**:

   - Ensure that you have a font installed that supports ligatures (like Fira Code).  
     Download and install Fira Code (if needed) from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code).

2. **Configure WezTerm to Use Ligature-Supporting Fonts**:
   In your WezTerm configuration file (`~/.wezterm.lua`), specify the ligature font as follows:

   ```lua
   local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

   return {
     font = wezterm.font("FiraCode Nerd Font"),  -- Use a font with ligatures
     font_size = 12.0,
     harfbuzz_features = {"calt=1", "clig=1", "liga=1"}  -- Enable ligatures
   }
   ```

3. **Test Ligatures**:
   Open a new WezTerm session, and type character sequences like:

   ```bash
   !=   ->   ===   <--   >=
   ```

   They will automatically render as ligatures: `≠`, `→`, `≡`, `←`, `≥`.

#### **Benefits of Font Ligatures**

- **Improved Readability**: Code with operators like `!==` and `===` becomes visually clearer.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Code looks cleaner and more polished, which can improve developer experience during long coding sessions.

```bash
nvim wezterm_font_ligature_rendering.md
