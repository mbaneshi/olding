WezTerm is highly customizable through **Lua scripting**, which allows users to deeply configure and extend the terminal's behavior. Lua is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language. With Lua scripts in WezTerm, you can:

- Customize key bindings, tab behavior, and pane layouts.
- Modify the look and feel, such as color schemes, fonts, and opacity.
- Create custom prompts or overlays.
- Automate tasks like session management or connecting to remote servers.
- Hook into WezTerm's event system to run custom scripts based on user or system actions.

This flexibility makes WezTerm adaptable to almost any workflow or user preference.

```bash
nvim wezterm_lua_customization.md
```
