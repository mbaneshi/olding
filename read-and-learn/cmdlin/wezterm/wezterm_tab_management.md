### 2. **Tab Management**:

WezTerm’s tab management feature allows users to open multiple terminal sessions within a single window, providing an organized workspace where you can switch between tasks easily. Each tab represents a separate terminal instance, enabling efficient multitasking.

#### **How Tab Management Works in WezTerm:**

Tabs in WezTerm allow you to have multiple shells or processes open within the same window without needing to clutter your desktop with multiple terminal windows. Each tab can be renamed, making it easier to track tasks or projects.

#### **Hands-on Example:**

Let’s assume you are working on a project with multiple environments — a development server, a monitoring session, and a database shell. You can set up each of these tasks in different tabs for easy access.

1. **Open a New Tab:**

   - Use the following key binding to open a new tab:
     ```bash
     Ctrl+Shift+t  # Open a new tab
     ```
   - A new terminal session will be started in this tab. You can start a new shell session or run a different process here (e.g., a development server).

2. **Switching Between Tabs:**

   - Use these key bindings to cycle through open tabs:
     - Move to the **next tab**:
       ```bash
       Ctrl+Tab
       ```
     - Move to the **previous tab**:
       ```bash
       Ctrl+Shift+Tab
       ```
     - Switch directly to a **specific tab** (e.g., Tab 3):
       ```bash
       Ctrl+3
       ```

3. **Renaming Tabs**:  
   To rename a tab (to keep track of tasks), you can right-click on the tab header and choose **Rename Tab**. Alternatively, you can use Lua scripting for automation.

#### **Customizing Tab Behavior with Lua**:

You can configure tab behavior by editing the WezTerm configuration in Lua, for example, adding key bindings or automatically renaming tabs based on running commands.

**Example Lua Config:**

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  -- Keybinding to create a new tab
  keys = {
    {key="t", mods="CTRL|SHIFT", action=wezterm.action{SpawnTab="CurrentPaneDomain"}},
  },

  -- Automatically rename tabs based on active process
  use_fancy_tab_bar = true,
  automatically_reload_config = true,

  tab_bar_at_bottom = true,  -- Example: place tab bar at the bottom
}
```

This configuration allows for more dynamic tab management, including renaming tabs or altering their position (top vs. bottom of the terminal window).

### **Benefits**:

- **Improved Organization**: Keep related tasks in separate tabs for easier management.
- **Quick Navigation**: Switch between tabs quickly to reduce task-switching overhead.

```bash
nvim wezterm_tab_management.md
```
