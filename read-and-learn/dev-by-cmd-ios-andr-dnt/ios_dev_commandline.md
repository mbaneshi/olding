Yes, it is possible to develop, test, and run iOS mobile apps using only command-line tools, though some dependencies on Xcode command-line utilities are unavoidable due to Apple's development ecosystem restrictions. Here's an overview of the process for building and running iOS apps purely from the command line:

---

### 1. **Prerequisites for Command-Line iOS Development**
- **Xcode Command-Line Tools**: While you can avoid the Xcode GUI, you still need the Xcode Command Line Tools. Install them with:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

- **CocoaPods**: Many iOS projects use CocoaPods for dependency management. Install it using:
  ```bash
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

### 2. **Using `xcodebuild` for iOS Development**
- **Create a New iOS Project**: You can initialize a new project using `dotnet` for a .NET MAUI project or manually create a project structure. If youâ€™re using a framework like Swift or Objective-C, you will have to manually set up the folder structure and files.

  For .NET MAUI:
  ```bash
  dotnet new maui -n MyiOSApp
  cd MyiOSApp
  ```

- **Build an iOS App**: You can build your project for a simulator or a real device using the `xcodebuild` command.

  - **Build for Simulator**:
    ```bash
    xcodebuild -scheme MyiOSApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'
    ```

  - **Build for Physical Device**:
    You need the `udid` (device identifier) for the target device:
    ```bash
    xcodebuild -scheme MyiOSApp -destination 'platform=iOS,id=your_device_udid'
    ```

  To find the `udid` of your iPhone:
  ```bash
  xcrun xctrace list devices
  ```

- **Signing & Provisioning**: If you're building for a physical device, iOS apps need to be code-signed. You can handle this using the command line by specifying the provisioning profile and certificate:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -scheme MyiOSApp -destination 'platform=iOS,id=your_device_udid' CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="iPhone Developer" PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER="YourProfile"
  ```

### 3. **Running the iOS App**
- **Run on a Simulator**: Once the app is built, you can run it on the iOS Simulator using `simctl`:
  ```bash
  xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 14"
  xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/your/app.app
  xcrun simctl launch booted com.your.bundleid
  ```

- **Run on a Physical Device**: You can also run the app on a physical iPhone connected to your system:
  ```bash
  xcrun xcodebuild -scheme MyiOSApp -destination 'platform=iOS,id=your_device_udid' build
  ios-deploy --debug --bundle /path/to/your/app.app
  ```

  Here, `ios-deploy` is an additional tool that helps deploy apps to physical iOS devices from the command line. Install it with:
  ```bash
  brew install ios-deploy
  ```

### 4. **Testing iOS Apps from the Command Line**
- **Unit Testing**: Use `xcodebuild` to run unit tests:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild test -scheme MyiOSApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'
  ```

- **UI Testing**: iOS supports XCTest for UI tests, and you can execute them directly from the command line with:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild test -scheme MyiOSApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14' -only-testing:UITests
  ```

- **Automated Testing**: You can also automate tests using continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to run `xcodebuild` commands as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

### 5. **Debugging iOS Apps from the Command Line**
- **LLDB (Low-Level Debugger)**: Once your app is running in the simulator or on a physical device, you can debug it using `lldb` from the terminal:
  ```bash
  lldb /path/to/your/app.app
  ```

  This gives you access to breakpoints, backtraces, and debugging functionalities, much like debugging in an IDE.

- **Logs & Crash Reports**: View device logs using `simctl` or `deviceconsole` for connected devices:
  ```bash
  xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'eventMessage contains "MyiOSApp"'
  ```

  Alternatively, for physical devices:
  ```bash
  idevicesyslog
  ```

### 6. **Continuous Deployment & App Store Submission**
While you can develop and run iOS apps from the command line, submission to the App Store still requires certain GUI interactions through Xcode or Fastlane tools.

- **Fastlane**: Automate deployments and code signing via Fastlane to handle App Store submissions directly from the terminal:
  ```bash
  brew install fastlane
  fastlane init
  ```

  You can use Fastlane to manage certificates, upload builds, and release apps to TestFlight or the App Store:
  ```bash
  fastlane pilot upload
  ```

---

### Summary of Steps
- **Develop**: Create, build, and configure apps using `dotnet`, `xcodebuild`, and the command line.
- **Test**: Use `xcodebuild` to run unit and UI tests directly on simulators or physical devices.
- **Run**: Launch apps using `simctl` for simulators or `ios-deploy` for physical devices.
- **Debug**: Use `lldb` and `xcrun` for logs and debugging without a GUI.

While this approach enables full command-line iOS development, certain tasks, such as creating the initial project template or App Store submission, may require minimal interaction with Xcode or tools like Fastlane.
