Here is a list of 10 well-crafted prompts designed to explore specific capabilities, limitations, and future trajectories of LLMs in relation to building projects:

1. **General Capabilities**:
   - *What are the tasks that LLMs are currently best at handling autonomously or with minimal supervision?*

2. **Programming & Code Generation**:
   - *How reliable are LLMs for generating full-scale production code, and what are their current limitations in areas such as efficiency, testing, and security?*

3. **Problem-Solving in Complex Domains**:
   - *Can LLMs solve complex, domain-specific problems in fields like system design, architecture, or compiler design? What are the limitations developers should be aware of?*

4. **Memory and Context Retention**:
   - *What challenges do LLMs face in retaining long-term context or managing multi-session conversations? How might these limitations impact software development projects that require persistent state?*

5. **Real-Time Data & API Interaction**:
   - *What are the challenges for LLMs when it comes to interacting with APIs or real-time data? How do current models fall short in dynamic, real-time environments?*

6. **Automating Development Tasks**:
   - *Which routine development tasks (e.g., code refactoring, debugging, and documentation) can LLMs fully automate today? Are there areas where human intervention remains necessary?*

7. **Limitations in Creativity and Innovation**:
   - *Where do LLMs fall short in generating creative solutions or innovations for tasks like architectural design, system optimization, or novel algorithm creation?*

8. **Future Growth**:
   - *What are the most likely improvements that LLMs will experience in the near future (e.g., better reasoning, handling edge cases, larger memory)? Which tasks are likely to be automated entirely?*

9. **Project Dependency**:
   - *What types of projects should developers avoid building around LLMs due to foreseeable future advancements? Which project types will benefit most from LLMs as support tools rather than full solutions?*

10. **Ethical and Trust Considerations**:
   - *What ethical challenges and reliability concerns should developers be aware of when integrating LLMs into systems that require high levels of trust, safety, or transparency?*
