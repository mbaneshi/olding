Here’s a refined version of the project prompt, tailored to streamline the conversation for effective guidance and focus on AI assistance, parallelization, state management, and offering APIs for broader use:

---

### **Project Title**: AI-Powered Universal Media to SVG Converter

---

### **Objective**:
Develop a **Python-based tool** that accepts various media formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, MP4) and converts them into **SVG format** through advanced **vectorization techniques** and **AI-powered assistance**. The tool should leverage **AI models** to:
- Gather similar ideas and concepts from previous SVG models or external services offering related functionalities.
- Implement **human supervision**, **task parallelization**, and **state management** to optimize workflow.
- Offer **rollback functionality** for error correction and provide a comprehensive **API** for developers, enabling robust transformations in a wide range of contexts with high accuracy.

The tool will offer:
- A **CLI using Typer** for easy terminal use.
- A **web interface with Streamlit** for user interaction.
- A **modular FastAPI** backend to handle business logic, API, and task distribution.
- **Postgres** as a datalayer to store transformations, states, and metadata.

### **Key Requirements**:
1. **Media Format Handling**: Support a variety of formats including images and video frame extraction.
2. **AI-Assisted Vectorization**: Utilize AI models for improved vectorization, referencing SVG libraries and similar tools.
3. **Customizable Vectorization**: Provide options for controlling the level of detail, quality, and SVG optimization.
4. **Human Supervision & Rollback**: Include mechanisms for human intervention in critical tasks and rollback features for reversing transformations.
5. **Task Parallelization & State Management**: Implement parallel task execution and state management to handle complex conversions.
6. **CLI and Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly CLI with **Typer** and a web interface with **Streamlit**.
7. **Modular FastAPI Backend**: Manage logic and APIs for external integration and workflow automation.
8. **Error Handling**: Optimize error detection for unsupported or corrupted media formats.
9. **Developer API**: Expose APIs for third-party integration, allowing others to leverage the tool’s media-to-SVG conversion functionality.

---

### **Technology Stack**:
- **Python**: Core logic, AI integration, and image processing.
- **Pillow and OpenCV**: Media input handling and manipulation.
- **Potrace**: Raster-to-vector conversion.
- **FastAPI**: Backend for handling logic, state management, and API.
- **Typer**: For CLI implementation.
- **Streamlit**: Web interface for user interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: For state and metadata storage.

### **Refined Prompt** for ChatGPT to Streamline Conversation:
> "We are developing an AI-powered tool for converting media formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, MP4) into SVG using Python. The tool should leverage AI for model comparison, parallel task execution, and state management. Additionally, it should offer CLI with Typer, a web interface with Streamlit, and APIs for third-party integration. Help us focus on the following areas:
> 1. AI-assisted vectorization and model referencing.
> 2. Implementing human supervision and rollback.
> 3. Parallel task execution and state management.
> 4. Designing modular FastAPI logic and handling Postgres as the data layer."
