"I want to learn Kotlin programming language specifically for Android development. Please guide me through the learning path by creating a high-level outline of a book that covers all the essential aspects of Kotlin in Android development. The outline should include:

1. Basics of Kotlin programming language, such as syntax, data types, control flow, and functions.
2. Object-oriented programming principles in Kotlin, including classes, interfaces, inheritance, and encapsulation.
3. Advanced Kotlin features like lambdas, coroutines, higher-order functions, and extension functions.
4. Kotlin for Android development:
   - Setting up Android Studio with Kotlin.
   - Understanding Android components (Activity, Fragment, Services, etc.) using Kotlin.
   - View handling and UI development in Kotlin.
   - Using Jetpack Compose with Kotlin.
5. Integration of Kotlin with Android libraries (Retrofit, Room, LiveData, etc.).
6. Testing in Kotlin for Android, covering both unit and UI testing.
7. Kotlin multiplatform development for sharing code across Android and other platforms.
8. Best practices and design patterns for scalable Android applications using Kotlin.
   
At the end of the book, there should be practical projects and exercises that apply these concepts in real-world Android app development scenarios."
