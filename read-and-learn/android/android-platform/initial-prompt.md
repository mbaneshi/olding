"I want to learn Android programming with a focus on design principles and component architecture. I need a comprehensive guide that will not only explain the fundamentals of Android UI/UX but also provide a deep dive into every key component of the Android platform. This should include layouts, views, activities, fragments, the Android lifecycle, resource management, and more. Ultimately, I want a high-level outline of a book that covers all aspects of Android programming in great detail—perfect for someone who wants to understand the platform in its entirety."
