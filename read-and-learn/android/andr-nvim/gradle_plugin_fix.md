The error message you're encountering indicates that Gradle cannot find the Android Gradle plugin specified in your `build.gradle` file. This usually happens if the Android Gradle plugin is not included in your project or if Gradle is not configured properly to find it.

### Here's how to fix this:

1. **Ensure You Have the Correct Gradle Wrapper:**
   Make sure you have the Gradle Wrapper configured in your project. The `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file should specify a version compatible with the Android Gradle plugin. You can create this file if it doesnâ€™t exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p gradle/wrapper
   ```

   Create or edit `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` to include:

   ```properties
   distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.4.2-bin.zip
   ```

   Adjust the version (`7.4.2`) to one that matches the requirements of your Android Gradle plugin.

2. **Modify Your `build.gradle` File:**
   In your root `build.gradle` file, you should include the `buildscript` section to specify the repository and version of the Android Gradle plugin. Modify your `build.gradle` file as follows:

   ```groovy
   // build.gradle
   buildscript {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.1.0' // Make sure this is the latest version
       }
   }

   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

   android {
       compileSdkVersion 34
       defaultConfig {
           applicationId "com.example.myandroidapp"
           minSdkVersion 21
           targetSdkVersion 34
           versionCode 1
           versionName "1.0"
       }
   }

   dependencies {
       implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
   }
   ```

   - Ensure that you use a compatible version of the Android Gradle plugin. You can check for the latest version on the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin).

3. **Rebuild Your Project:**
   After making the above changes, try running the build command again:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

   This will use the Gradle Wrapper specified in your project.

4. **Additional Steps:**
   If you continue to experience issues, consider clearing your Gradle cache and syncing your project again:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ```
