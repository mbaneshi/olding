To further decouple the system while ensuring high performance, maintainability, and scalability, it's essential to focus on separating concerns and adhering to principles such as modularity, loose coupling, and single responsibility. Here’s a comprehensive approach to decouple each aspect of the system:

### 1. **Decoupling Back-End and Front-End**

   - **Separate Projects**: Keep the front-end (Streamlit) and back-end (FastAPI) as separate projects, with individual dependencies and configurations. This separation allows for independent deployment and scaling.
   - **API-First Design**: Design the system with an API-first approach. The FastAPI back-end should provide RESTful or GraphQL APIs that the Streamlit front-end consumes. This ensures the front-end and back-end can evolve independently.
   - **Communication via HTTP/HTTPS**: Use standard protocols for communication between front-end and back-end (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS). With HTTP clients like `httpx` in the Streamlit app, you can make API calls to the FastAPI server.
   - **WebSocket for Real-Time Updates**: For real-time communication, use WebSocket connections. This will allow the front-end to receive updates (e.g., task status changes) without polling continuously.

### 2. **Decoupling the Data Layer**

   - **Repository Pattern**: Introduce a repository layer that abstracts database interactions. This layer would provide methods to fetch and manipulate data without exposing the details of the database implementation. The service layer should interact with repositories instead of raw database sessions.
   - **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Create a data access layer to handle all database interactions using repositories. This layer can then be replaced or extended (e.g., switching from SQLAlchemy to a different ORM or using multiple data sources).
   - **Database Interface Abstraction**: Use interfaces to define database operations. This allows for easily swapping out implementations (e.g., switching from a SQL database to a NoSQL one) without changing the service layer code.

### 3. **Service Layer for Business Logic**

   - **Single Responsibility for Services**: Each service should have a specific responsibility (e.g., ProfileService, TaskService). This makes it easier to maintain and test.
   - **Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI’s dependency injection for services, making it easy to manage dependencies (e.g., repositories, other services) and swap out implementations.
   - **Asynchronous Programming**: Implement async methods for services dealing with I/O-bound tasks. Asynchronous programming ensures the system remains performant under heavy load.

### 4. **Task Scheduling and Background Processing**

   - **Task Queue (Celery/Redis)**: Use a task queue like Celery with Redis for background processing. This decouples long-running or resource-intensive tasks from the main request/response cycle, improving responsiveness.
   - **Microservices for Task Execution**: For more advanced decoupling, break down task execution into microservices that communicate with the central FastAPI server. Each microservice can handle specific types of tasks (e.g., web scraping, API calls).
   - **Message Broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ)**: Use a message broker to send events between different services (e.g., notifying the front-end when a task is completed).

### 5. **Configuration and Environment Decoupling**

   - **Environment Variables and Configuration Files**: Use `python-dotenv` for loading environment-specific settings, making the system flexible across different deployment environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
   - **12-Factor App Principles**: Follow the 12-factor app methodology for configurations. This ensures that the application is portable and adheres to cloud-native practices.

### 6. **Decoupling Authentication and Authorization**

   - **External Authentication Providers**: Use OAuth2, JWT, or external providers like Auth0 for authentication. This abstracts away the details of user management and allows integration with different authentication mechanisms.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement a fine-grained permission model to decouple access control from the rest of the business logic.

### 7. **Asynchronous Data Fetching and Caching**

   - **Caching Layer**: Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data. This reduces load on the database and speeds up API responses.
   - **Async Data Fetching**: For the front-end, use async data fetching techniques to avoid blocking the UI and improve responsiveness.

### 8. **Code Structure and Design Patterns**

   - **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**: Implement a hexagonal architecture to further decouple the core application logic from external systems (e.g., databases, task queues). This pattern ensures that business logic is independent of the frameworks used.
   - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events to trigger actions within the system (e.g., task completed events can update logs, send notifications). This decouples different parts of the system, allowing for independent scaling and easier maintenance.
   - **Factory Pattern for Dependency Resolution**: Use factory patterns for creating objects, especially when dealing with different types of services (e.g., different automation processes). This makes swapping out implementations easy.

### 9. **Monitoring and Logging**

   - **Centralized Logging**: Use a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack) to collect logs from different parts of the system. This makes it easier to debug issues and monitor performance.
   - **Metrics Collection**: Implement metrics collection (e.g., using Prometheus) to monitor the performance of each service, helping with identifying bottlenecks.

### 10. **Testing Strategies**

   - **Unit Tests for Services and Repositories**: Focus on unit testing individual services and repository functions. This ensures the correctness of core business logic.
   - **Integration Tests for API and Task Scheduler**: Integration tests should cover API endpoints and task execution scenarios, ensuring that all components work together as expected.
   - **Contract Tests for External APIs**: When integrating with third-party APIs (e.g., GitHub, OpenAI), use contract testing to validate assumptions about these external services.

### 11. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

   - **Automated Testing Pipeline**: Implement a CI pipeline that runs tests on each code push, ensuring code quality before deployment.
   - **Separate Deployments for Front-End and Back-End**: Deploy the front-end and back-end independently, allowing for more flexible and faster updates.
   - **Containerization (Docker)**: Use Docker to containerize each part of the system (FastAPI back-end, Streamlit front-end, task workers). This helps in achieving a consistent deployment environment.

### Updated Dependencies

With these changes in mind, you may consider adding some dependencies for better decoupling and performance:

- **For Task Queue**: `celery`, `redis`
- **For Caching**: `aioredis` (async Redis client)
- **For Logging and Monitoring**: `structlog`, `prometheus_client`
- **For Testing**: `pytest`, `httpx[async]`, `pytest-asyncio`

### Conclusion

Decoupling each aspect of your system will result in a more modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture. By adopting the practices and patterns above, you can achieve a highly cohesive system where each component can evolve independently while maintaining robust interactions.
