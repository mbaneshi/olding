For the **database layer design**, we should start by defining models for profiles, services, proxies, and commands. The associations would look like this:

1. **Profiles Table**:
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `directory`, `tokens`, `services_linked`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

2. **Services Table**:
   - Fields: `id`, `service_name` (e.g., GitHub, OpenAI), `api_token`, `settings`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
   - Relationship: Link to profiles.

3. **Proxies Table**:
   - Fields: `id`, `address`, `port`, `type`, `authentication`, `profile_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

4. **Commands Table**:
   - Fields: `id`, `command_name`, `profile_id`, `proxy_id`, `service_id`, `command_script`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
   - This will map how commands link to profiles, proxies, and services.

Does this structure fit your expectations, or do you have additional requirements for these models?
