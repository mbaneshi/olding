### Project Definition:

We are developing a **comprehensive admin panel** using **FastAPI** for the backend and **Streamlit** for the front-end, aimed at managing various automation processes, Chrome profiles, services (e.g., GitHub, OpenAI), and proxy configurations. The system focuses on **command composition**, task orchestration, and real-time status tracking. This centralized panel will act as the orchestrator, executing automation tasks (e.g., Playwright browser automation) using subprocesses. 

The project involves integrating a **task scheduler** (such as Celery or APScheduler), real-time tracking of automation tasks, data persistence for logs and results, a modular UI, and various third-party API integrations.

### Mission Overview:

1. **System Capabilities**:
   - **Centralized Automation Management**: Provide a platform for managing automation tasks, such as browser automation with Playwright, API interactions, and other scheduled tasks.
   - **Chrome Profile Management**: Maintain multiple Chrome profiles with isolated settings for tasks, services, and proxy configurations.
   - **Third-Party Service Integration**: Manage and automate interactions with platforms like GitHub, Twitter, OpenAI, etc., using stored API tokens.
   - **Task Scheduling and Orchestration**: Implement a flexible scheduling system for tasks, supporting both recurring and on-demand execution.
   - **Data Persistence and Result Tracking**: Store logs, results, and status of automated tasks for audit and visualization.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Database Layer**: 
     - Manage **profiles**, **services**, **proxies**, **commands**, and **tasks**, establishing foreign key relationships to link configurations to profiles.
     - Persist **automation results** and **logs** for each task execution.
   - **Command Composition System**:
     - Support the creation of commands to control subprocesses like Playwright.
     - Commands will use **profile-specific settings**, **proxy configurations**, and **service tokens** for executing automation tasks.
   - **Task Execution and Tracking**:
     - Orchestrate **task scheduling** via Celery or APScheduler.
     - Use **WebSockets or polling** for real-time status updates.
     - Display task logs, outputs, and results on the UI.
   - **Streamlit-based Front-End**:
     - **Dashboard**: Show an overview of profiles, tasks, recent results, and automation status.
     - **Profile Management**: CRUD operations for Chrome profiles.
     - **Command Interface**: Compose and execute commands from the UI.
     - **Task Scheduling**: Interface to manage and schedule tasks.
     - **Result Visualization**: Show data collected from automation tasks in charts, tables, or logs.
   - **Error Handling and State Management**:
     - Centralized error handling in FastAPI with logging and monitoring.
     - State management in Streamlit, using session state and Redis.

3. **Dependencies and Tools**:
   - **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Celery (or APScheduler).
   - **Front-End**: Streamlit.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for data persistence.
   - **Automation**: Playwright for browser-based tasks.
   - **Other Tools**: Redis, WebSockets, and Sentry for monitoring.

### Goals and Next Steps:

1. **Decouple System Components**: Ensure separation between front-end, back-end, task scheduling, and data persistence.
2. **Implement State Management**: Use Streamlitâ€™s session state for front-end and Redis for backend state tracking.
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Set up centralized error management, logging, and monitoring.
4. **Follow Best Practices**:
   - Design Patterns: Repository pattern, dependency injection, and observer pattern.
   - Modular Architecture: Separate services, profiles, and command handling.

The system will emphasize modularity, scalability, and maintainability to support dynamic automation tasks. The admin panel will act as a robust tool for managing automation processes across different services and environments.
