For scaling the system and accommodating the comprehensive admin panel requirements, here are the main areas to address based on the current directory structure:

### 1. **Database Changes**:
   - **File:** `back/models/`  
     - Create new models for profiles, services, proxies, commands, tasks, schedules, and results.
     - Define relationships using foreign keys to link configurations.
     - **Add new model files** (e.g., `profile.py`, `service.py`, `proxy.py`, `command.py`, `task.py`, `result.py`).
   - **File:** `back/alembic/versions/initial_migration.py`  
     - Update the migration script to reflect the new database schema.

### 2. **API Layer Modifications**:
   - **File:** `back/api/`  
     - Add new routes to support CRUD operations for the new models (e.g., `profiles.py`, `services.py`, `commands.py`, `tasks.py`, `results.py`).
     - **Modify `main.py`** to include the new route modules.
   - **File:** `back/schemas/`  
     - Add Pydantic models for validation and serialization for each new entity (e.g., `profile.py`, `service.py`, etc.).

### 3. **Business Logic Changes (CRUD & Orchestration)**:
   - **File:** `back/crud/`  
     - Add new CRUD operations for managing profiles, commands, and tasks (e.g., `profiles.py`, `services.py`, `commands.py`, etc.).
     - Implement orchestration functions for command composition and task scheduling.
   - **File:** `back/core/config.py`  
     - Add configurations related to task scheduling (e.g., Celery, APScheduler) and database optimizations.

### 4. **Task Scheduling and Automation Execution**:
   - **File:** `back/main.py`  
     - Set up task scheduler integration (Celery or APScheduler).
     - Implement routes for starting/stopping tasks and querying task statuses.
   - **File:** `back/core/`  
     - Create a new file `tasks.py` to define background tasks for automation, scheduling, and integration with subprocesses (Playwright).

### 5. **Frontend (Streamlit UI) Changes**:
   - **File:** `front/pages/`  
     - Add new Streamlit pages for profiles, tasks, commands, and results (`profiles.py`, `commands.py`, `tasks.py`, `results.py`).
     - Implement a **navigation sidebar** in `front/main.py` to access the new pages.
   - **File:** `front/utils/http_client.py`  
     - Update the client to interact with the new API endpoints.
   - **File:** `front/command-to-run-st.txt`  
     - Update with new commands for starting the Streamlit app with multiple pages.

### 6. **Result Handling and Notification System**:
   - **File:** `back/api/`  
     - Add WebSocket or polling endpoints to handle real-time updates (status tracking, notifications).
   - **File:** `front/pages/results.py`  
     - Display logs, task statuses, and output using Streamlit components (e.g., tables, charts).

### Summary of Files to Change:
- **Backend Changes**:
   - `back/models/` (add new models)
   - `back/alembic/versions/initial_migration.py` (update migration)
   - `back/api/` (add new route modules)
   - `back/schemas/` (new schemas)
   - `back/crud/` (new CRUD operations)
   - `back/core/config.py` (scheduler config)
   - `back/core/tasks.py` (task scheduling)

- **Frontend Changes**:
   - `front/pages/` (add new pages)
   - `front/main.py` (update navigation)
   - `front/utils/http_client.py` (update API calls)

Implementing these changes will help achieve a scalable system with the needed features. Let me know if you need details on any specific component.
