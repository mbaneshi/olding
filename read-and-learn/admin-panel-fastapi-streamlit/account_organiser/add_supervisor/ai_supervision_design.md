### Summary
You are developing a system involving backend, UI (admin panel), and PostgreSQL, where you need human supervision on agentic AI tasks. Below is a solid design solution for integrating human supervision into the workflow, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### Design Solution for Human Supervision in Agentic AI Assistance:

#### 1. **Task Categorization & Risk Assessment:**
   - **Classify tasks** into levels of risk or importance (e.g., "low-risk," "high-risk") based on their nature and the potential impact of automation errors.
   - Implement an **assessment engine** within the backend to tag tasks with appropriate categories and assign supervision requirements.

#### 2. **Review Workflow:**
   - Implement a **task queue system** where tasks awaiting human review are stored. Integrate with PostgreSQL to store metadata for each task, including:
     - Task ID
     - Task category
     - Task status (e.g., "Pending Review," "Automated Decision," "Completed")
     - Assigned reviewers
   - Use **message queues** like RabbitMQ or Kafka to manage asynchronous task handling and ensure scalability.

#### 3. **Admin Panel for Human Supervision:**
   - Provide a **supervision dashboard** in the admin panel that allows human reviewers to:
     - **View pending tasks**: Display critical metadata and allow reviewers to make decisions.
     - **Override AI decisions**: Include options for humans to modify or override the AI’s actions before final execution.
     - **Reassign tasks**: Support reassignment to different reviewers based on workload or expertise.
   - Build real-time task updates using **WebSockets** or **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to notify the admin of new tasks or changes.

#### 4. **Audit & Logging:**
   - Integrate detailed logging mechanisms for **auditing purposes**, recording all human interventions in tasks, decisions made, and timestamps.
   - Ensure the audit trail is stored in PostgreSQL for compliance and debugging.

#### 5. **Escalation and Notification System:**
   - Build an **escalation system** for tasks that stay in the queue too long, or when an immediate human response is needed (e.g., a task flagged as urgent).
   - Send **notifications** to reviewers via email, SMS, or in-app alerts for high-priority tasks.

#### 6. **Machine-Human Feedback Loop:**
   - Design a feedback loop where human reviewers’ decisions influence AI behavior, improving its future performance (active learning).
   - This can be done by periodically retraining the AI models based on supervised data from human interventions.

### Implementation Tools:
   - **Backend**: Use Node.js or Go, integrating with PostgreSQL.
   - **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for task distribution.
   - **Admin Panel**: Frontend with React/Next.js for a responsive interface. Use WebSockets for real-time task monitoring.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing task metadata and audit logs.
  
This design ensures a balance between automation and human oversight, fostering accountability while maintaining operational efficiency.
