### **Project Summary**

We are developing a **modular and extensible admin panel** entirely in Rust, designed for centralized automation management. This system aims to streamline tasks such as browser automation, API interactions, and task scheduling while leveraging Rust's performance and safety.

### **Chosen Technology Stack**

1. **Backend**: 
   - **Axum**: A web framework for building APIs in Rust. It provides a type-safe, async-first approach to developing web applications.
   - **SQLx**: An asynchronous, compile-time checked SQL query builder for Rust, used for database interactions.

2. **Frontend**: 
   - **Yew**: A modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly, enabling a responsive and dynamic user interface.

3. **Database**:
   - A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) managed via SQLx for data persistence and CRUD operations.

4. **Real-time Updates**:
   - WebSockets or polling mechanisms for tracking task status in real-time.

5. **State Management**:
   - Redis for caching and managing session states.

### **Conclusion**

By employing a Rust-centric tech stack, our project ensures high performance, safety, and maintainability. The combination of Axum and SQLx allows for robust API development and efficient database management. Yew provides a powerful framework for building a dynamic user interface, making it easier to manage automation tasks seamlessly. This system will enable users to orchestrate various automation processes effectively, enhancing productivity and streamlining workflows.
