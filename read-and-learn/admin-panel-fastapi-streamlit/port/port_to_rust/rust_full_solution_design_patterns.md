Designing a fully Rust-based system for this type of project involves choosing design patterns and architecture that leverage Rust's strengths: **concurrency**, **safety**, and **performance**. We need to ensure that the project is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain while taking advantage of Rust's powerful features like its **ownership model**, **type system**, and **traits**.

Let's break down the **best design patterns** and **practices** for building this system.

---

### **1. Modular Architecture with Cargo Workspaces**

Using **Cargo workspaces** allows us to organize the project into separate crates for each of the system’s major components. This not only helps to isolate concerns but also makes it easier to test and maintain the code.

- **Workspaces** are ideal for this system since you can define each module (e.g., `task_scheduler`, `database_layer`, `web_server`, `command_handler`, `realtime_updates`) as a separate crate within the workspace.
  
#### Example of Workspace Structure:
```
├── automation-admin-panel/
│   ├── Cargo.toml (workspace definition)
│   ├── task_scheduler/       (Crate for scheduling tasks)
│   ├── database_layer/       (Crate for SQLx database management)
│   ├── web_server/           (Crate for Axum or Actix Web API)
│   ├── command_handler/      (Crate for handling automation commands)
│   ├── websocket_service/    (Crate for WebSocket support)
│   └── shared/               (Crate for shared types and utils)
```

#### Benefits:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each crate handles a specific part of the system, making it easy to swap out or upgrade components.
- **Clear boundaries**: Crates define clear APIs that other components can interact with, reducing coupling.

### **2. Task Scheduling with Tokio and Actor Model (Concurrency)**

For task scheduling and handling long-running tasks, such as Playwright subprocesses or real-time task monitoring, the **actor model** can help organize tasks efficiently. Actors are isolated, independent units of computation that communicate via message passing, making them ideal for asynchronous systems.

#### Why Use the Actor Model?
- It allows **fine-grained control** over each task.
- **Concurrency** is easier to reason about because actors don’t share mutable state.
- **Message passing** makes the system more scalable and easier to debug.

#### Implementing the Actor Model:
1. **Tokio** for async task handling.
2. Use the **`actix` crate** to define actors for task execution.
3. Each actor handles a specific task, such as managing Playwright subprocesses or API requests.

##### Actor Implementation Example (Using `actix`):
```rust
use actix::prelude::*;

// Define a message type for scheduling tasks
struct ScheduleTask {
    pub task_id: i32,
    pub command: String,
}

impl Message for ScheduleTask {
    type Result = Result<(), ()>;
}

// Define an actor responsible for handling tasks
struct TaskActor;

impl Actor for TaskActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

impl Handler<ScheduleTask> for TaskActor {
    type Result = Result<(), ()>;

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: ScheduleTask, _: &mut Self::Context) -> Self::Result {
        println!("Executing task {} with command: {}", msg.task_id, msg.command);
        // Here we would run the command via subprocess or API interaction
        Ok(())
    }
}

// Spawning an actor and sending it tasks
fn schedule_tasks() {
    let system = System::new();
    
    system.block_on(async {
        let addr = TaskActor.start();
        addr.send(ScheduleTask {
            task_id: 1,
            command: "playwright test".to_string(),
        })
        .await
        .unwrap();
    });

    system.run().unwrap();
}
```

#### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Actors can scale independently and handle multiple tasks in parallel.
- **Isolation**: Faults are isolated to specific actors, improving reliability.

### **3. Command Composition with Traits and Builder Pattern**

In Rust, the **trait system** combined with the **builder pattern** allows you to create highly flexible and composable command execution logic. This is ideal for defining commands that interact with different services, profiles, and proxies.

#### Traits for Command Composition:
Each type of command (e.g., launching Playwright, using proxies, calling third-party APIs) can implement a common **trait** for command execution.

##### Command Trait Example:
```rust
pub trait Command {
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<String, String>;  // Return result of execution
}

struct PlaywrightCommand {
    script: String,
}

impl Command for PlaywrightCommand {
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<String, String> {
        println!("Executing Playwright command: {}", self.script);
        // Subprocess handling logic here
        Ok("Success".to_string())
    }
}

struct ApiCallCommand {
    url: String,
}

impl Command for ApiCallCommand {
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<String, String> {
        println!("Calling API: {}", self.url);
        // API call logic here
        Ok("API call success".to_string())
    }
}
```

#### Builder Pattern for Command Customization:
The **builder pattern** enables flexible construction of commands with various configurations (e.g., adding proxies, tokens).

##### Example of Command Builder:
```rust
struct CommandBuilder {
    script: Option<String>,
    proxy: Option<String>,
}

impl CommandBuilder {
    fn new() -> Self {
        CommandBuilder {
            script: None,
            proxy: None,
        }
    }

    fn script(mut self, script: &str) -> Self {
        self.script = Some(script.to_string());
        self
    }

    fn proxy(mut self, proxy: &str) -> Self {
        self.proxy = Some(proxy.to_string());
        self
    }

    fn build(self) -> PlaywrightCommand {
        PlaywrightCommand {
            script: self.script.unwrap_or_default(),
        }
    }
}
```

#### Benefits:
- **Extensibility**: New commands can easily be added by implementing the `Command` trait.
- **Flexibility**: Commands can be composed with various options (e.g., profiles, proxies) using the builder.

### **4. Web Server with Axum/Actix Web (REST API)**

For the backend API, **Axum** and **Actix Web** are two of the most popular frameworks in Rust. They are asynchronous, highly performant, and well-suited for building APIs similar to FastAPI.

#### Axum Setup (With Command and Task APIs):
```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router, Json};
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

// Define a command execution API
async fn execute_command(Json(payload): Json<ExecuteCommandRequest>) -> Json<ExecuteCommandResponse> {
    // Logic for executing the command
    Json(ExecuteCommandResponse { status: "ok".to_string() })
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ExecuteCommandRequest {
    command: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct ExecuteCommandResponse {
    status: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/execute", get(execute_command));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 8080));
    println!("Listening on {}", addr);
    axum::Server::bind(&addr).serve(app.into_make_service()).await.unwrap();
}
```

#### Benefits of Axum/Actix Web:
- **Concurrency**: Handle thousands of concurrent requests due to Tokio-based async model.
- **Performance**: Known for low latency and high throughput.

---

### **5. Real-Time Task Updates with WebSockets**

To track the status of long-running tasks, **WebSockets** can be implemented via **`tokio-tungstenite`** or natively in **Actix Web**.

#### WebSocket Real-Time Updates:
```rust
use tokio_tungstenite::{accept_async, tungstenite::protocol::Message};
use futures_util::{StreamExt, SinkExt};

async fn websocket_handler(stream: TcpStream) {
    let ws_stream = accept_async(stream).await.unwrap();
    let (mut write, mut read) = ws_stream.split();

    // Send real-time updates
    write.send(Message::Text("Task started...".to_string())).await.unwrap();
    
    while let Some(msg) = read.next().await {
        println!("Received: {}", msg.unwrap().to_text().unwrap());
    }
}
```

#### Benefits:
- **Real-time communication**: WebSockets provide immediate feedback on task status.
- **Asynchronous and lightweight**: Integrated easily into the task scheduling system.

---

### **6. Centralized Error Handling with `anyhow` and `tracing`**

To manage errors effectively across the system, use `anyhow` for error handling and `tracing` for logging and monitoring.

#### Error Handling Example:
```rust
use anyhow::Result;

fn risky_operation() -> Result<()> {
    // Potential error
    Err(anyhow!("Something went wrong"))
}

fn main() {
    if let Err(e) = risky_operation() {
        println!("Error: {}", e);
    }
}
```

#### Logging with `tracing`:
```rust
use tracing::{info, error};

fn log_example() {
    info!("This is an info log");
    error!("This is an error log");
}
```

---
