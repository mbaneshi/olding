Choosing the right tools for your Rust project is crucial, especially when it comes to database interactions and web frameworks. Both SQLx and Diesel serve as excellent database libraries in Rust, while Axum and Actix are popular web frameworks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each option to help you decide which fits your project best.

### **SQLx vs. Diesel**

#### **SQLx**
- **Asynchronous Support**: SQLx provides built-in support for asynchronous database interactions, making it a great fit for a project using Tokio for async task scheduling.
- **Runtime Agnostic**: Works with any async runtime, giving you flexibility to choose your runtime (e.g., Tokio, async-std).
- **Compile-Time Verification**: SQLx can verify your SQL queries at compile time if you use the `sqlx-cli` tool, reducing runtime errors related to SQL syntax.
- **Lightweight**: SQLx is less opinionated about the database schema, allowing you to work with raw SQL, which is ideal for applications that need complex queries or those transitioning from a different database structure.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want maximum control over SQL queries and prefer raw SQL.
- If your application is heavily async and you want to fully leverage that capability.
- When you require more flexibility in working with different database types or schemas.

#### **Diesel**
- **Type Safety**: Diesel is a more opinionated ORM that provides a high level of type safety, reducing the chance of runtime errors.
- **Query Builder**: Offers a fluent API for constructing queries, which can make working with complex queries more manageable.
- **Migrations**: Built-in support for database migrations, which can simplify versioning your database schema.
- **Sync and Async Support**: Diesel has a synchronous API by default but can work with async through a compatibility layer (not as seamless as SQLx).

**Use Cases**:
- When you prefer a strong type system and are okay with more constraints on your query patterns.
- If you require more extensive tooling for migrations and schema management.
- When your application can afford to work synchronously or you're willing to manage async with additional complexity.

### **Conclusion on Database Layer**
**Recommendation**: **SQLx** is likely the better fit for your project because:
- It aligns well with the async nature of your application using Tokio.
- It offers greater flexibility for complex SQL queries, which may be essential for handling dynamic database interactions in your admin panel.

### **Axum vs. Actix**

#### **Axum**
- **Built on Tokio**: Axum is designed to work seamlessly with the Tokio async runtime, making it an excellent choice for async applications.
- **Modular**: It follows a more modular approach with support for Extractors, which allows you to easily retrieve data from requests (like JSON body, path parameters, etc.).
- **Ease of Use**: The API design is simple and user-friendly, making it easier to get started and to maintain.
- **Integration**: Good integration with other Tokio-based libraries, making it suitable for building an entire async ecosystem.

**Use Cases**:
- When building new async applications where simplicity and integration are key.
- If you appreciate a functional style of programming and prefer working with smaller, reusable components.

#### **Actix**
- **Performance**: Actix is one of the fastest web frameworks available in Rust, thanks to its actor model architecture.
- **Flexibility**: Offers a wide range of features and flexibility, allowing for complex routing and middleware functionalities.
- **Synchronous and Asynchronous Support**: Actix can handle both sync and async code, although it primarily emphasizes async programming.

**Use Cases**:
- If performance is the highest priority and your application requires handling many concurrent connections.
- When you need a framework that supports both synchronous and asynchronous code effectively.

### **Conclusion on Web Framework**
**Recommendation**: **Axum** is the preferred choice for your project because:
- It aligns with your asynchronous design goals and integrates well with SQLx.
- It offers a simpler and more modular design that makes building and maintaining your admin panel easier.

### **Overall Recommendation**
**Final Choice**: Combine **SQLx** with **Axum** for your project. This combination allows you to leverage the full power of Rust's async capabilities while maintaining a clean, modular, and type-safe architecture. 

- **SQLx** will handle your database interactions with async capabilities, giving you flexibility in SQL usage.
- **Axum** will serve as the web framework, providing a user-friendly approach to handling requests and responses in an async manner.

This stack aligns perfectly with your goals for a modular and extensible Rust-based admin panel, ensuring optimal performance and developer experience.
