### **Mission Summary**

Our mission is to develop a **modular and extensible Rust-based admin panel** that enables centralized automation management for various tasks, including browser automation, API interactions, and task scheduling. The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing Chrome profiles, services, proxies, and commands, while leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency features.

### **Project Overview**

The project involves the following key components:

1. **Database Layer**:
   - Manage profiles, services, proxies, commands, and tasks.
   - Persist logs and results for each task execution.
   - Utilize **SQLx** for asynchronous database interactions.

2. **Web Framework**:
   - Implement an API using **Axum** to handle requests and responses.
   - Support real-time updates and task status tracking.

3. **Front-End**:
   - Use **Yew** or **Seed** for a Rust-based web UI.
   - Provide features like profile management, command composition, task scheduling, and result visualization.

4. **Task Scheduling and Orchestration**:
   - Integrate a task scheduler (like Celery or APScheduler).
   - Enable real-time tracking of automation tasks using WebSockets or polling.

5. **Error Handling and State Management**:
   - Implement centralized error handling in Axum.
   - Use Redis for state management and caching.

### **Crafted Prompt for Restarting the Project**

"Develop a modular and extensible admin panel using Rust, focused on centralized automation management. The system should include a robust database layer managed by SQLx, a web API built with Axum, and a front-end using Yew or Seed. The panel must support task scheduling, real-time updates, error handling, and user-friendly interfaces for managing profiles, services, proxies, and commands."

### **Detailed Implementation Plan**

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Set up a new Rust project with a Cargo workspace for modular structure.
   - Create submodules for each key component (database, API, front-end).

2. **Database Layer Implementation**:
   - Define database models for profiles, services, proxies, commands, and tasks.
   - Use SQLx to implement database interactions with async support.
   - Implement CRUD operations and migrations for database schema.

3. **Web API Development**:
   - Set up Axum as the web framework.
   - Implement routes for managing profiles, commands, and tasks.
   - Integrate middleware for error handling and logging.

4. **Front-End Development**:
   - Choose between Yew or Seed for building the UI.
   - Implement a dashboard for visualizing task statuses and results.
   - Create forms for managing profiles, services, and commands.

5. **Task Scheduling and Orchestration**:
   - Choose a suitable task scheduler and implement its integration.
   - Develop the logic for scheduling and executing tasks asynchronously.
   - Use WebSockets or polling for real-time updates on task statuses.

6. **Error Handling and State Management**:
   - Implement centralized error handling using logging crates.
   - Set up Redis for caching and managing session states.

7. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Write unit tests for each module and API endpoint.
   - Create documentation for the API and system components for easier onboarding.

8. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Create a Dockerfile for containerization and deployment.
   - Set up monitoring tools for tracking system performance and errors.
