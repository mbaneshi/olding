**Summary:** Anthropic has introduced two upgraded AI models: **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and **Claude 3.5 Haiku**. The **Sonnet** model includes a groundbreaking feature in public beta: **computer use**, enabling Claude to interact with computers like humans by moving cursors, clicking, and typing. This capability is still experimental and prone to errors but allows automation of tasks through an API that translates prompts into commands. **Claude 3.5 Haiku**, the fastest version, surpasses many models in coding performance. These releases aim to enhance workflows, especially in coding and general computer tasks.
