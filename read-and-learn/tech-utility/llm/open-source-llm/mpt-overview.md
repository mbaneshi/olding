#### **Local Setup Capability**

MPT models are designed for **efficient local deployment** and can be run on various hardware configurations, from **high-end GPUs** to more modest setups. Here's a detailed overview of the local setup requirements:

1. **Hardware Requirements**:

   - **MPT-7B** (7 billion parameters): Requires at least **16 GB of GPU memory** (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090 or A100) for inference and fine-tuning. A machine with **32 GB of system RAM** will be sufficient for most tasks.
   - **MPT-30B** (30 billion parameters): This larger variant requires multiple GPUs with a total of **24–32 GB VRAM** and around **64 GB of system RAM** for efficient performance.
   - **Storage**: MPT-7B takes about **20 GB** of disk space, while MPT-30B requires around **60 GB**.

2. **Software Requirements**:

   - You will need **Python** and libraries like **Hugging Face Transformers**, **PyTorch**, and **CUDA** (for GPU acceleration). MPT models are available via **Hugging Face**.
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers accelerate deepspeed
     ```

3. **Local Setup Steps**:

   - Loading the MPT-7B model for inference:

#### **Character Limit and Tokenization**

MPT models use **byte-pair encoding (BPE)** tokenization, which efficiently handles large vocabularies across different domains and languages. They are optimized for **long-sequence processing**, supporting up to **65,000 tokens**.

- **Token Limit**: Depending on the variant, the token limit ranges from **4,096** tokens for general models to **65,000** tokens for long-context models like **MPT-7B-65K**.
- **Character Limit**: As the tokenization scheme varies, the character limit for a prompt depends on how the text is tokenized. For example, in general English text, 1 token corresponds to roughly 4 characters, so MPT-7B can process about **16,000 characters** in a single pass.
