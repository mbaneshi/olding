To help you get started with fine-tuning models and understanding popular tools in this space, here's a ChatGPT prompt tailored to your background and interest in APIs, LLMs, and fine-tuning:

---

**Prompt:**

*"I am a developer with advanced math knowledge and experience using APIs for LLMs. I am now interested in fine-tuning language models. Please provide an overview of popular tools like PyTorch, Hugging Face, and LangChain. Specifically, I would like to understand:*
- *What each tool does and how it helps in the fine-tuning process.*
- *How they integrate or can be used together.*
- *Their role in model training, data handling, or API interaction.*
- *Any key concepts, terminology, or steps I need to be aware of as I start exploring fine-tuning in more depth."*
