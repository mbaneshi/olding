Yes, **Step 1** (Set Up Hugging Face API) involves downloading the model files to your machine, which requires disk space. Models like `Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B` can be **very large**, often several gigabytes in size, depending on the specific model.

If you're short on disk space, you can try the **Hugging Face Inference API** instead (Step 3 in my earlier response). This approach does not require downloading the model to your machine. Instead, you'll interact with the model hosted on Hugging Face's servers, only sending and receiving data via API calls.

To use the Inference API programmatically:
1. **Install `huggingface_hub`** (as mentioned earlier).
2. You can call the API like this:
   ```python
   from huggingface_hub import InferenceApi

   # Use the inference API directly
   model_name = "nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF"
   api = InferenceApi(model_name)

   # Example input prompt
   prompt = "Explain the significance of AI in modern technology."

   # Call the model API
   response = api(inputs=prompt)

   print(response)
   ```

This will let you use the model without worrying about local storage space.
