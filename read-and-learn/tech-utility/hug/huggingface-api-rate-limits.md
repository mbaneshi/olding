As a new user on Hugging Face, the free tier for their Inference API does have rate limits, although specific numbers aren't always clearly defined. Generally, new users on the free plan may experience restrictions, especially under high-volume periods. Many have reported encountering a `429 Rate Limit` error, which indicates you've reached the limit, and the limit typically resets every hour.


If you require higher throughput or consistency, upgrading to the **Pro** plan or using **Inference Endpoints** (which provide dedicated infrastructure) can help you bypass some of these restrictions. The free plan is great for exploration but has its limits due to shared resources【16†source】【18†source】. 

To manage your calls efficiently, monitor your API usage and be prepared for throttling if you're making multiple requests within a short period.
