### Summary of the NVIDIA API Catalog Welcome Email

The NVIDIA API Team welcomes new users to the NVIDIA API catalog and informs them that their API credits are now active. Users should ensure they have their API key, which can be obtained by selecting a model in the catalog and clicking "Get API Key." They are encouraged to test the performance and throughput of models using NVIDIA NIM.

To extend access and continue testing, users can sign up for a 90-Day Evaluation of NVIDIA AI Enterprise by logging in, selecting their initials, and filling out a request form. This will grant additional credits and a trial license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise.

For assistance in connecting with an NVIDIA Account Manager, users can reply to the email for support.
