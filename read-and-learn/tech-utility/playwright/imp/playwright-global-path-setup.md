To ensure **Playwright** is available on your **path**, let's go through the steps to properly install and configure it on your system.

### 1. **Global Installation of Playwright**

The first thing you'll need is to install Playwright globally so that it can be accessed from any directory. You can achieve this using **npm**.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g playwright
```

This installs **Playwright globally**, making it accessible from any directory.

### 2. **Verify Playwright Installation**

After installation, verify that Playwright is available globally by running:

```bash
playwright --version
```

This should return the Playwright version, indicating that it has been installed successfully.

### 3. **Add Playwright to Path (if needed)**

If the **npm global bin directory** isn’t added to your system's `PATH`, Playwright might still not be found. Here’s how to ensure that:

- **Check the npm global bin directory:**

  ```bash
  npm bin -g
  ```

  This command will return a directory like `/usr/local/bin`. If this directory isn’t in your `PATH`, you’ll need to add it.

- **Add npm bin directory to PATH in Fish Shell**:

  Since you're using the **Fish shell**, add the path as follows:

  ```bash
  set -U fish_user_paths (npm bin -g) $fish_user_paths
  ```

  This adds the global npm bin directory to your `PATH` and makes Playwright accessible from any directory.

### 4. **Check Playwright Availability**

Now you can check if the Playwright command is available by running it from a random directory, e.g.:

```bash
cd ~/some/other/directory
playwright --help
```

If everything is set up correctly, this command will output Playwright's help menu, showing it is accessible globally.

### 5. **Begin Using Playwright**

Now that Playwright is globally accessible, you can begin running scripts like:

```bash
node playwright-gather-chatgpt.js
```

Feel free to kick off your automation journey!

```bash
nvim playwright-global-path-setup.md
```
