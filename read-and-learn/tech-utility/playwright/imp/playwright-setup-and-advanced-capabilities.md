### Checking and Setting Up Playwright with pnpm on Mac

To check and set up Playwright with `pnpm` on your Mac and ensure it’s available globally, follow these steps:

#### 1. **Check pnpm Installation**

First, ensure that `pnpm` is installed globally by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

If you don’t have it installed, you can install `pnpm` globally with:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### 2. **Check Playwright Installation**

You can check if Playwright is installed within your project by navigating to your project folder and running:

```bash
cd /Users/macbookair/xplayground/my-playwright-project
pnpm list playwright
```

If Playwright isn’t installed, install it in your project with:

```bash
pnpm add @playwright/test --save-dev
```

#### 3. **Make Playwright Available Globally**

To make Playwright commands available globally, you can add them to your system’s `PATH`. First, locate where `pnpm` installs your packages. You can find this by running:

```bash
pnpm bin
```

This will show the directory where binaries for your pnpm packages are located. You can then add this directory to your `PATH` in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.config/fish/config.fish`, depending on the shell you use).

For example, in Fish shell:

```bash
set -Ux fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths /path/to/pnpm/bin
```

Now, Playwright should be available in any terminal session.

### Advanced Playwright Capabilities Over Selenium and Puppeteer

Here’s an overview of some **advanced capabilities** in Playwright that surpass Selenium and Puppeteer:

#### 1. **Cross-Browser Automation**

- **Playwright** supports running tests in **Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit** with a unified API. This provides better test coverage across multiple browsers compared to Selenium and Puppeteer.
- **Selenium** relies on WebDriver for browsers, which sometimes lags behind in support for new browser versions.

#### 2. **Automatic Browser Updates**

- **Playwright** bundles browser versions, making it easy to install and manage the latest versions automatically. Selenium requires you to manage browser versions and WebDriver binaries manually.

#### 3. **Native Emulation of Mobile Devices**

- Playwright can natively emulate mobile devices and test responsive web applications with precise settings like device geolocation, network conditions, and even camera/microphone permissions. Puppeteer can do this to some extent, but Selenium requires complex setups.

#### 4. **Network Interception and Request/Response Mocking**

- Playwright has robust capabilities to intercept network requests and mock responses, allowing you to manipulate HTTP traffic at will during testing. Puppeteer has basic request interception, but Selenium lacks an efficient way to do this without third-party libraries.

#### 5. **Auto-Waiting and Stable Tests**

- **Playwright** automatically waits for elements to be ready before interacting with them. This eliminates the need for `sleep` or manual wait statements, making your tests more stable and faster. Selenium and Puppeteer often need additional wait times or custom logic to handle async operations correctly.

#### 6. **Headless Mode with UI Snapshots**

- While all tools support headless execution, **Playwright** allows you to take full-page screenshots, snapshots of the UI, and even record videos of the test execution, which can be very useful for debugging.

#### 7. **Parallelization and Sharding**

- Playwright allows for easy test parallelization and test case sharding across multiple browsers or configurations, greatly speeding up test execution times. Selenium supports parallelization but with more complex configuration.

#### 8. **Built-in Test Runner**

- **Playwright** includes a built-in test runner (`@playwright/test`) with features like test retries, annotations, and grouping of tests. Selenium and Puppeteer don’t have an integrated test runner and usually rely on external ones like Jest or Mocha.

#### 9. **Integration with Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**

- Playwright is optimized for CI/CD environments with better support for headless browser testing, parallelization, and automatic retries in case of flaky tests. It works seamlessly with popular CI platforms like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.

### Summary

- **Playwright** offers superior features such as cross-browser testing, automatic browser updates, network interception, mobile emulation, and built-in parallelization.
- **Selenium** is still a robust option for compatibility but lacks the advanced features for modern testing.
- **Puppeteer** is focused more on Chromium-based testing and lacks the cross-browser flexibility and some advanced automation capabilities of Playwright.

#### Example Shell Command to Run Playwright Test:

```bash
pnpm playwright test --headed
```

This runs your Playwright tests in headed mode to visualize the browser while running the test.
