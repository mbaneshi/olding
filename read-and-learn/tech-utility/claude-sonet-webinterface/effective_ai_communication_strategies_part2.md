You're right to point out that having to request this format each time isn't ideal for user experience. Unlike ChatGPT, I don't have customizable settings or the ability to remember preferences across conversations. This is one of the limitations of my current implementation.

To make this process more efficient within our constraints, here are a couple of suggestions:

1. You could use a shorthand request, like "filename please" or even just "filename", and I'll understand to provide the code block with a descriptive filename.

2. If you're planning a series of related conversations, you could ask me to number the filenames at the start of each new chat, like this:

```bash
nvim effective_ai_communication_strategies_part2.md
```

While I can't automatically provide this format without prompting, I'm always happy to accommodate specific formatting requests within each conversation. If you have any other ideas for how we can streamline this process within my current capabilities, I'm open to suggestions.
