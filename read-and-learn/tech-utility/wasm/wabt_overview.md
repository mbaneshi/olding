WABT (pronounced "wabbit") is a comprehensive suite of tools designed for working with WebAssembly, aimed at simplifying the manipulation and analysis of WebAssembly files. Below is a breakdown of its key components and their functionalities:

1. **wat2wasm**: This tool converts WebAssembly Text Format (.wat) files into WebAssembly Binary Format (.wasm). It is essential for compiling human-readable code into a format that can be executed by WebAssembly runtimes.

2. **wasm2wat**: The reverse of wat2wasm, this tool translates binary WebAssembly files back into the text format. This is useful for debugging or understanding the structure of WebAssembly binaries.

3. **wasm-objdump**: Similar to the `objdump` utility for native binaries, this tool prints detailed information about a WebAssembly binary, including its functions, sections, and other critical data.

4. **wasm-interp**: A stack-based interpreter that decodes and executes WebAssembly binary files, enabling developers to run WebAssembly code without the need for a full runtime environment.

5. **wasm-decompile**: This tool takes a WebAssembly binary and attempts to decompile it into a more readable C-like syntax, making it easier to analyze the underlying code.

6. **wat-desugar**: This parses the .wat text format, which may include s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed syntax, and outputs it in a canonical flat format, ensuring compliance with the specification.

7. **wasm2c**: Converts a WebAssembly binary file into C source and header files, facilitating interoperability with C-based systems or projects.

8. **wasm-strip**: A utility for removing unnecessary sections from a WebAssembly binary, effectively reducing its size and improving load times.

9. **wasm-validate**: This tool checks the validity of a WebAssembly binary file, ensuring it adheres to the WebAssembly specification.

10. **wast2json**: Converts a file in the WebAssembly specification test format (.wast) into a JSON file along with associated WebAssembly binary files, aiding in automated testing scenarios.

11. **wasm-stats**: Outputs various statistics about a WebAssembly module, providing insights into its structure and performance characteristics.

12. **spectest-interp**: Reads a Spectest JSON file and executes its tests using the interpreter, allowing for thorough validation of WebAssembly implementations.

### Usage Context
These tools are primarily intended for developers creating toolchains or systems that need to manipulate WebAssembly files. Unlike the WebAssembly specification interpreter, which emphasizes simplicity and strict adherence to the specification, WABT tools are implemented in C/C++ for easier integration into larger systems. They are not focused on optimization like Binaryen; rather, they maintain fidelity to the WebAssembly spec, ensuring that conversions and analyses retain the original instructions without modification.
