To enable software written for one CPU architecture to run on another architecture, various translation and emulation techniques can be employed. Below is a list of available options categorized by their primary function:

### 1. **Binary Translation**

- **Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT)**: Translates executable code at runtime, converting it into native code for the host architecture.
  - **Examples**:
    - **QEMU**: A popular open-source emulator and virtualizer that performs DBT.
    - **Valgrind**: Primarily a programming tool for memory debugging, but can also provide DBT capabilities.
- **Static Binary Translation**: Converts binary code from one architecture to another before execution.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Transitive's QuickTransit**: Allows applications compiled for one architecture to run on another by translating them statically.

### 2. **Emulators**

- Software that simulates a hardware environment and can run programs compiled for different architectures.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Bochs**: An open-source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator that can emulate various CPU architectures.
    - **Wine**: While primarily for running Windows applications on Unix-like systems, Wine can also provide an emulation layer for x86 applications on ARM systems.

### 3. **Cross-Compilation**

- A technique where code is compiled on one architecture to be executed on another.
  - **Examples**:
    - **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Can be configured to generate code for different architectures.
    - **Clang**: Another compiler that supports cross-compilation for various architectures.

### 4. **Compatibility Layers**

- These provide a set of APIs that mimic another platform's libraries and functions, enabling software to run without modification.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: Allows running Linux binaries on Windows.
    - **Docker**: Provides containerization that can abstract the underlying architecture in some cases, especially with multi-architecture images.

### 5. **Virtualization**

- This involves running an entire virtual machine on top of the host OS, which can mimic a different architecture.
  - **Examples**:
    - **VMware**: Allows running virtual machines that can use different architectures than the host.
    - **Parallels Desktop**: Emulates different operating systems on Mac hardware.

### 6. **JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time)**

- Converts bytecode or intermediate representation to native machine code at runtime.
  - **Examples**:
    - **HotSpot JVM**: Used in Java, it compiles Java bytecode to native code for the host architecture at runtime.
    - **Mono**: An open-source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework that includes JIT compilation.

### 7. **Transpilers**

- Tools that convert source code from one programming language to another, often accommodating different architectures.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Emscripten**: Compiles C/C++ code to WebAssembly, which can run in modern browsers regardless of architecture.

### Summary

Different tools and techniques cater to the need for running software across different CPU architectures. The choice of method often depends on the specific requirements, including performance, compatibility, and ease of use.
