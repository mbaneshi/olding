Endianness refers to the order of bytes in multi-byte data types. It can be either:
- **Little-endian:** where the least significant byte is stored first (at the lowest address).
- **Big-endian:** where the most significant byte is stored first (at the lowest address).

Endianness is crucial in systems programming, networking, and data serialization as it affects how data is interpreted across different architectures.
