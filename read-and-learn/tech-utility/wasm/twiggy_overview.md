### Twiggy Overview

**Twiggy** is a powerful tool designed to analyze WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries. Its primary purpose is to assist developers in understanding the size and dependencies of functions within a Wasm binary. By analyzing the call graph of a binary, Twiggy provides insights that can help in optimizing and reducing the size of binaries.

#### Key Features

1. **Call Graph Analysis**: Twiggy examines the relationships between functions, allowing developers to see which functions call others and why certain functions are included in the binary.

2. **Retained Size Calculation**: It calculates the retained size of each function, which indicates the potential size savings if that function (and any functions that become unreachable as a result) were removed from the binary.

3. **Optimization Insights**: By identifying functions that can be removed or optimized, developers can make informed decisions to slim down their Wasm binaries, ultimately improving performance and load times.

### Use Cases

- **Understanding Inclusion**: Developers can inquire why specific functions are part of the binary. This is particularly useful for debugging or optimizing larger applications.

- **Identifying Dead Code**: By determining which functions can be removed without affecting functionality, Twiggy aids in cleaning up the codebase and reducing binary size.

- **Performance Tuning**: Smaller binaries lead to faster downloads and execution times, making applications more responsive.

### Example Workflow

1. **Installation**: Install Twiggy in your development environment.
2. **Analyze Binary**: Run Twiggy on your Wasm binary to generate a call graph.
3. **Review Output**: Examine the output to identify functions that can be removed or optimized.
4. **Refactor Code**: Make changes to your codebase based on Twiggyâ€™s recommendations.
5. **Re-analyze**: Run Twiggy again to see the impact of your changes on the binary size.

### Conclusion

By utilizing Twiggy, developers can gain valuable insights into their Wasm binaries, ultimately leading to more efficient applications. It serves as an essential tool for anyone looking to optimize their WebAssembly code for better performance and reduced size.
