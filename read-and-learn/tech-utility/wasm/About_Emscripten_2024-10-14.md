Emscripten is a complete open-source compiler toolchain for WebAssembly (Wasm). It allows developers to:

- Compile C/C++ code, or any language using LLVM, into WebAssembly, which can run on web browsers, Node.js, or other Wasm runtimes.
- Compile C/C++ runtimes of other languages into WebAssembly, enabling indirect code execution for languages like Python and Lua.

Emscripten can handle virtually any portable C/C++ codebase, ranging from high-performance games to frameworks like Qt. It has already been used in commercial codebases such as Unreal Engine 4 and Unity. For examples and demos, refer to the community-maintained wiki list.

### Key Features
- **Efficient Code Generation**: Emscripten generates small and highly optimized code, leveraging WebAssembly for near-native performance while maintaining portability and security.
- **Automatic Optimization**: By integrating with tools like LLVM, Binaryen, and Closure Compiler, Emscripten handles many optimizations automatically.

### Toolchain Overview
The main tool in the Emscripten toolchain is the **Emscripten Compiler Frontend (emcc)**, which serves as a drop-in replacement for compilers like `gcc` or `clang`. It uses Clang/LLVM to compile to WebAssembly and emits JavaScript to provide API support to the compiled code. This JavaScript can run in Node.js or a browser via HTML.

- **Emscripten SDK (emsdk)**: The SDK installs the complete toolchain, including `emcc` and LLVM, and is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### Porting Code to Emscripten
Emscripten offers comprehensive support for portable C/C++ code, including the C/C++ standard libraries, exceptions, and APIs like SDL2. OpenGL support is excellent for OpenGL ES 2.0 code, and it also supports other versions to a lesser extent.

However, differences between native and Emscripten runtime environments may require some changes to the code. For example, applications typically need to modify the main loop and adapt file handling due to browser and JavaScript limitations.

For more details on portability issues, developers should consult the **Portability Guidelines**.
