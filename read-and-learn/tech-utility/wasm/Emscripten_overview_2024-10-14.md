Emscripten is an open-source compiler toolchain that translates C, C++, and other languages into WebAssembly (Wasm) and JavaScript. It enables you to run native code in web browsers at near-native speed, allowing applications written in these languages to be ported to the web. Emscripten also provides a compatibility layer for OpenGL, POSIX system calls, and other environments, making it versatile for both gaming and high-performance applications.
