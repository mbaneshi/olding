You've highlighted a fundamental challenge in computer architecture: **architecture dependency**. Different CPUs, such as x86, ARM, and PowerPC, each have their own instruction sets (machine languages), meaning that code written for one CPU architecture won't run natively on another without some form of translation or emulation.

This non-portability can lead to several issues, including:

1. **Development Overhead**: Developers must often write different versions of software for different architectures, increasing the time and effort needed to maintain codebases.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Code may need to be optimized separately for each architecture to take advantage of specific features and instructions, making it more complex to manage.

3. **Dependency on Compilers**: While high-level languages can abstract away some architecture details, they still require compilers that understand the target architecture, adding another layer of dependency.

To mitigate these issues, strategies like using **virtual machines** (VMs) or **containers** can provide a more consistent runtime environment, but they come with their own trade-offs in performance and complexity.

Would you like to explore this topic further or discuss specific architectures or solutions?
