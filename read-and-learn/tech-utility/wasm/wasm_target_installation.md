It looks like you are using a non-Rustup installation of Rust, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is missing from your setup. Since you're using a direct Homebrew installation of Rust, you will need to manually install the target.

Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

### Manual Installation of `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Target

1. **Verify the correct Rust compiler path**:
   - Confirm that you are using the correct installation of Rust by checking your `rustc` path.
     ```bash
     which rustc
     rustc --version
     ```

2. **Manually install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target**:
   Since you are not using `rustup`, you need to manually add the Wasm target to your toolchain.

   - Download and install the WebAssembly target:
     ```bash
     /opt/homebrew/bin/rustc --print sysroot
     ```
     Find the sysroot path and manually place the WebAssembly target within the correct location.

     Alternatively, it’s easier and safer to install **Rustup** to manage targets, as it allows for much simpler toolchain management.

3. **Switch to Rustup**:
   If managing Rust through Homebrew seems cumbersome, I would recommend switching to **Rustup**, as it simplifies toolchain management and lets you easily install different targets.

   **Steps to switch to Rustup:**
   - Install Rustup:
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - Configure your shell to use Rustup:
     ```bash
     source $HOME/.cargo/env
     ```
   - Install the Wasm target:
     ```bash
     rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
     ```

   - Re-run the `wasm-pack build` command:
     ```bash
     wasm-pack build --target web
     ```
