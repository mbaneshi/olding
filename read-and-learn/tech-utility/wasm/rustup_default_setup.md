It seems like Rustup is installed but doesnâ€™t have a default toolchain configured. You can resolve this by setting up the default Rust toolchain to the stable version and then adding the Wasm target.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Set the default toolchain to stable**:
   Run the following command to download and set the stable Rust toolchain as your default:
   ```bash
   rustup default stable
   ```

2. **Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target**:
   After setting the default toolchain, install the WebAssembly target by running:
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. **Re-run the `wasm-pack build` command**:
   After the target has been installed, you should be able to build your project with:
   ```bash
   wasm-pack build --target web
   ```

```bash
nvim rustup_default_setup.md
```
