You're absolutely right that **WebAssembly (WASM)** provides a powerful means of overcoming many traditional web limitations. It allows for near-native performance in the browser by enabling compiled languages like C, C++, and Rust to run alongside JavaScript. This technology has indeed helped bridge the gap between desktop and web applications, particularly for performance-heavy use cases. However, while WebAssembly brings significant advantages, there are still some limitations and nuances when comparing something like AutoCAD with other complex web apps like financial charting applications.

Here’s a deeper look at the comparison and why we still don’t see fully-fledged applications like AutoCAD on the web despite the existence of WASM:

### 1. **WebAssembly Performance vs. Native Performance**
   - **WASM is Fast, But Not Equal to Native**: While WebAssembly brings near-native performance, there is still some overhead, especially in areas like garbage collection, system calls, and threading. For performance-critical applications such as CAD, this small overhead can add up, especially when working with high-resolution models, real-time 3D rendering, and handling massive datasets.
   - **Browser APIs Limitations**: Even with WASM, you're still dependent on browser APIs like WebGL (or WebGPU) for graphics rendering. These APIs, while improving, aren't yet as robust as native graphics APIs like DirectX or OpenGL, which applications like AutoCAD deeply rely on.

### 2. **Financial Charting vs. CAD Complexity**
   - **UI Complexity**: Financial charting applications, though complex in terms of their UI, tend to deal with data visualization, which is more lightweight compared to the graphic manipulation involved in CAD systems. Financial charts use mostly 2D graphics and are heavily optimized for real-time data display. CAD applications, on the other hand, deal with intricate 2D and 3D modeling, vector manipulation, and physics-based simulations, which are much more demanding on both the CPU and GPU.
   - **Data Processing**: While financial applications handle vast amounts of data, much of this data is numerical and can be optimized through algorithms that aren't as resource-intensive as 3D model manipulation. CAD files are spatial and geometric in nature, requiring heavy matrix computations, precision transformations, and rendering that require much more powerful resources.

### 3. **WebAssembly’s Current Limitations**
   - **Multithreading**: WebAssembly has support for multithreading through Web Workers, but it's not as seamless as native multithreading found in desktop applications. For applications like AutoCAD, which require high concurrency and parallel computations (e.g., real-time rendering, physics simulations), the current state of WebAssembly multithreading may not be sufficient.
   - **Memory Management**: Browsers impose limits on memory usage, and while WASM can allocate memory efficiently, there’s still a ceiling on how much can be allocated compared to a native application. This limitation can restrict CAD applications from handling very large files or highly detailed models effectively in the browser.
   - **Lack of Direct Access to Hardware**: Even with WebAssembly, web apps are still limited in their ability to directly interact with the hardware (e.g., direct GPU, CPU, and RAM access). Native apps like AutoCAD can leverage deep system optimizations and platform-specific APIs (e.g., GPU drivers) to achieve higher performance, which isn’t fully possible with web-based applications.

### 4. **Fine-Grained UI Handling**
   - **Rich UI in Financial Apps**: Financial charting apps, as you mentioned, are quite advanced in terms of UI and interactivity. However, these UIs often handle simpler inputs like clicks, drags, and real-time updates of graphical elements (charts). In contrast, CAD applications need to manage far more complex input handling, like precision drawing, dynamic rotations, zooming into infinitesimal points, and intricate user interactions that require pixel-perfect accuracy.
   - **GPU and Render Optimization**: Financial apps are heavily optimized for handling data points and rendering UI components, but CAD apps require rendering complex 3D models and materials in real time, often with detailed lighting, textures, and depth calculations. Achieving the same level of fidelity and interactivity in a browser remains a challenge.

### 5. **Desktop Integration**
   - **System and Peripheral Integration**: Desktop applications like AutoCAD can tightly integrate with operating systems, devices, and peripherals (e.g., 3D mice, digitizers, VR/AR systems). While WebAssembly can interact with some hardware through browser APIs, the integration is not as deep or performant as native desktop applications.
   - **File System and Storage**: Although WebAssembly can work with files via APIs like `FileSystem` and `IndexedDB`, native desktop applications have more flexible and faster access to the local file system, allowing for better performance with large files and datasets.

### 6. **Evolution of WebAssembly and Future CAD on Web**
   - **WebAssembly Evolution**: WebAssembly is evolving fast, and future iterations (with support for features like **SIMD**, **garbage collection**, **native threading**, and **direct system calls**) will likely close the gap even further between desktop and web applications. The introduction of **WebGPU** also aims to make web graphics rendering much closer to native performance. In time, we could see applications like AutoCAD or similar tools running smoothly in the browser, but the technology is still catching up.
   - **Example of Web-Based CAD**: Autodesk has already started experimenting with lighter, cloud-based versions of their CAD software (like **AutoCAD Web App**) but these are scaled-down versions. Similarly, other tools like **Onshape** offer cloud-based CAD functionality, though they are still not on par with the full desktop experience.

### Conclusion
WebAssembly provides a significant leap in web application performance, making it possible to run complex applications in the browser. However, for extremely performance-intensive applications like CAD software, the limitations related to memory, multithreading, hardware access, and real-time rendering still prevent them from achieving the same level of performance as native desktop applications. 

While financial charting applications can handle fine-grained UIs and intensive data processing, they are still less demanding than the intricate modeling, rendering, and computational tasks required for CAD applications.

As WASM, WebGPU, and browser capabilities continue to evolve, it's possible we may see fully-fledged applications like AutoCAD running in the browser in the future. For now, though, the web simply cannot match the performance and capabilities of desktop applications for such high-demand software.
