Yes, you're absolutely correct! Crafting a **simplified version of a CAD application** for the web is feasible, especially if you target less complex use cases and work with simpler data formats. While the full complexity of an application like AutoCAD might still pose challenges, creating a lightweight web-based CAD tool is certainly possible using technologies like **WebAssembly (WASM)** and **WebGPU/WebGL**.

### Key Points for Developing a Simpler Web CAD:

1. **Using a Simple File Format (Like DXF)**:
   - **DXF (Drawing Exchange Format)** is a relatively straightforward file format for 2D vector graphics. It's a plain text or binary format designed for exchanging drawing information between different CAD applications. Since DXF focuses primarily on 2D data, it is much simpler to parse, render, and manipulate than something like DWG, which handles both 2D and 3D data with more complexity.
   - **Web Implementation**: You could create a web-based CAD application that specifically handles DXF files, which would reduce the complexity of the software. DXF's simpler structure means the web app would be processing mainly lines, arcs, polylines, and basic geometric shapes, which are easier to render in a browser using **WebGL** or **Canvas**.

2. **Limiting Features to Reduce Complexity**:
   - **Basic 2D Drawing**: Instead of handling full 3D models, your web-based CAD could focus on **2D drawing and editing**, which is computationally far less demanding. You could implement core features like:
     - Drawing lines, arcs, circles, and polylines.
     - Zooming, panning, and rotating the canvas.
     - Basic transformations like scaling, translating, and rotating objects.
   - **Constraints and Simplicity**: The UI could be designed to handle simpler use cases, such as schematic drawings, architectural blueprints, or floor plans, without needing the sophisticated modeling tools required for 3D rendering.

3. **Leveraging WebAssembly and WebGL**:
   - **WebAssembly for Performance**: Even a simpler version of a CAD app could benefit from WebAssembly to handle DXF parsing, geometric transformations, and calculations with near-native speed. For example, you could write the core logic in **C++** or **Rust** and compile it to WebAssembly to boost performance.
   - **WebGL or WebGPU for Rendering**: For rendering 2D or basic 3D objects, **WebGL** is mature and widely supported. It can handle the rendering of DXF primitives (lines, arcs, and polygons). For more advanced graphics, **WebGPU** (currently in development) would provide even better performance with more direct access to the GPU.

4. **Efficient UI and Interaction**:
   - **Simplified UI**: Financial applications that you mentioned have finely-tuned UIs, and this is achievable for simpler CAD applications too. You can implement a user-friendly interface for selecting tools, drawing objects, and managing layers (common in CAD). Using **SVG** or **Canvas** for the UI layer, combined with **WebGL** for rendering the DXF content, could provide a smooth user experience.
   - **Interaction with Models**: Providing real-time interaction with the drawn objects (e.g., selecting, moving, resizing) can be implemented with JavaScript or WebAssembly to ensure fast, responsive behavior. **fuzzy searching** for elements within a file, as used in financial apps, could also be adapted here to make navigation more user-friendly.

5. **File Parsing and Exporting**:
   - **Parsing DXF**: There are already open-source libraries available for parsing DXF files in both JavaScript and other languages like C++ and Rust (which could be compiled to WebAssembly). This makes it relatively straightforward to build the file import/export functionality for your web-based CAD.
   - **Editing and Saving**: Users could be given the ability to make basic edits to the drawing (e.g., add lines, move shapes) and save these changes back into a DXF format or export it to other lightweight vector formats like **SVG** or **JSON**.

6. **Examples of Similar Projects**:
   - **JS-based CAD Tools**: There are already web-based CAD tools that are relatively simple, such as **LibreCAD** (open-source, mainly for 2D drafting) and **OpenJSCAD**, which is aimed at parametric 3D modeling but demonstrates how 2D/3D modeling can work in a browser.
   - **Autodesk AutoCAD Web**: As mentioned earlier, Autodesk has a **web-based version of AutoCAD**. Though it’s a scaled-down version of their desktop app, it shows that there is growing potential for this type of application on the web.

7. **Challenges and Opportunities**:
   - **Resource Management**: Even with simpler 2D tools, you'll need to manage memory efficiently, especially when handling large DXF files with many elements. Using **WebAssembly** will help, but browser memory limitations still need to be considered.
   - **Performance Optimization**: You can optimize performance further by offloading heavier tasks (like certain computations or rendering) to **Web Workers** to prevent the main thread (and the UI) from freezing.

### Example Workflow for a Simpler Web CAD:
- **File Import**: User uploads a DXF file → WebAssembly parses the DXF file into primitives.
- **Rendering**: Use WebGL to render the DXF's 2D entities on a canvas. Allow zooming and panning.
- **Editing**: Users can select entities, move, rotate, or scale them using a simplified toolbar.
- **File Export**: After editing, the modified data is re-encoded into DXF or another format for download.

### Conclusion:
Building a simpler version of a CAD application on the web, especially one focused on 2D drawings using a format like **DXF**, is definitely achievable with current web technologies. Leveraging **WebAssembly** for performance, **WebGL/WebGPU** for rendering, and maintaining a simpler feature set can make this possible while bypassing many of the constraints faced by fully-fledged CAD applications.

By focusing on a narrower scope—like basic 2D drawings, DXF file manipulation, and web-based tools—you can create a lightweight CAD tool that serves a specific set of users without needing the full complexity and resource demand of a desktop CAD system.
