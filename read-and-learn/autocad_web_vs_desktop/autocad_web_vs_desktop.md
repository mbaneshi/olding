The main reasons we don't see complex applications like AutoCAD fully implemented on the web come down to several technical challenges related to performance, resource management, and browser limitations. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **High Performance Requirements**
   - **Hardware Acceleration**: Applications like AutoCAD rely heavily on hardware acceleration (GPU) for rendering complex 2D and 3D graphics efficiently. While WebGL and WebGPU enable some hardware acceleration in web browsers, they aren't as optimized or powerful as native GPU access on desktop applications. 
   - **Computational Load**: CAD software requires significant computational resources, both in terms of CPU and GPU, to handle the rendering, editing, and manipulation of detailed, complex models. Web environments generally offer less computational power and memory than a desktop environment.

### 2. **File I/O and Resource Management**
   - **Local File System Access**: Desktop applications like AutoCAD can access the file system directly, manage large files (like DWG files), and perform efficient reading and writing operations. Web applications are limited in terms of file system access and are constrained by browser sandboxing, which makes managing large files less efficient.
   - **Memory Constraints**: Browsers are designed to handle tasks within safe memory limits to prevent any single webpage from consuming too many system resources. This restricts the ability of web applications to handle the enormous memory demands required by CAD software.

### 3. **Real-Time Interactivity**
   - **Low-Latency User Input**: Applications like AutoCAD require real-time responsiveness to user inputs (e.g., drawing, rotating, zooming). Native desktop apps have minimal latency in user interactions, while web apps must deal with the overhead of browser environments, causing higher latency.
   - **Concurrency and Parallelism**: AutoCAD makes use of multithreading and other concurrency features that are better supported in desktop environments compared to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript in the browser (though Web Workers are used to handle concurrency on the web, they are limited in scope).

### 4. **Platform-Specific Features**
   - **Native Libraries and APIs**: CAD applications like AutoCAD leverage platform-specific APIs and libraries (e.g., DirectX, OpenGL) to achieve optimal performance, which are not fully available in the web environment. While some of these are being replaced by web standards like WebAssembly and WebGPU, they are still in their infancy compared to native desktop APIs.
   - **Heavy Use of Custom UI**: Desktop applications have highly customizable, optimized UIs that are tailored to take advantage of native system calls. Web applications, on the other hand, have to conform to HTML/CSS standards, which can limit the flexibility and performance of complex UIs.

### 5. **Storage and Network Dependency**
   - **Cloud Dependency**: While it's possible to create web-based CAD tools, they often require a strong internet connection to interact with cloud-based servers for storage and processing. This dependency can lead to slower performance compared to a local desktop installation.
   - **Persistent Local Data**: Storing large models and working offline is easier with desktop applications. On the web, solutions like IndexedDB and localStorage are available, but they are not designed for handling extremely large files or datasets efficiently.

### 6. **Security and Privacy Concerns**
   - **Sandboxing and Security**: Browsers are sandboxed environments, which limit the access web apps have to the system. While this is great for security, it also limits the ability to interact with the system in ways that a desktop app like AutoCAD requires (e.g., accessing system resources or hardware directly).

### 7. **Development Complexity**
   - **Cross-Platform Browser Support**: Developing a web-based version of AutoCAD would require the application to work consistently across different browsers and operating systems, each with its own performance and API differences, making development significantly more complex.
   - **WebAssembly**: While WebAssembly allows compiling high-performance languages like C++ to run in the browser, it is still not as fast or efficient as running natively on the desktop, particularly for applications as demanding as CAD software.

### Alternatives and Progress:
While traditional AutoCAD doesn't run entirely in the browser, there are lighter, web-based CAD alternatives, such as **AutoCAD Web App** and **TinkerCAD**. However, these are simplified versions aimed at offering limited functionality due to the aforementioned constraints. Web-based applications may evolve with improvements in technologies like **WebAssembly** and **WebGPU**, allowing more complex applications to be feasible in the browser.

**Summary**: Complex applications like AutoCAD are currently better suited for desktop environments due to performance, resource management, and platform-specific requirements that the web cannot fully support.
