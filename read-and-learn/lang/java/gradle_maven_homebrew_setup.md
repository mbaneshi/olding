It looks like you have successfully installed both **Gradle** and **Maven**, and they are now using **OpenJDK 23** provided by Homebrew:

- **Gradle** version: 8.10.2  
  Using **Java 23** (Homebrew).

- **Maven** version: 3.9.9  
  Also using **Java 23** from Homebrew.

### Summary of Your Setup:
- **Gradle** and **Maven** are installed via **Homebrew** and are configured to use **OpenJDK 23**.
- The **JVM** used by both tools is located at:
  ```bash
  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk/23/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
  ```

### Next Steps:
- You can decide whether to switch to using **OpenJDK 23** as your default JDK for other Java projects (instead of **OpenJDK 21**). To do so, you would set `JAVA_HOME` to:

  ```bash
  set -x JAVA_HOME /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk/23/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
  ```

  You can make this permanent in Fish as described previously.

This setup should now work smoothly without redundancy, as both **Maven** and **Gradle** are using the same JDK installed via Homebrew.
