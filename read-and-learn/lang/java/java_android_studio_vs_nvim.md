You can start Java application development with either **Android Studio** or your **Neovim** setup, depending on your preferences and workflow. Here's a comparison of both approaches:

### **Android Studio**:
- **Pros**:
  - **Out-of-the-box support for Android development**: It comes with all the necessary tools like the Android SDK, emulators, and integrations for building Android apps.
  - **Graphical interface**: Easier to manage layouts, activities, and debug using the built-in tools.
  - **Pre-configured Gradle**: Automates the build and dependency management, which is essential for Android apps.
  - **Code Assistance**: Android Studio provides advanced code completion and Android-specific support like XML layout editing.

- **Cons**:
  - **Heavier on system resources**: Requires more memory and CPU power compared to a lightweight setup with Neovim.
  - **Less customizable**: Android Studio doesnâ€™t allow the same level of customization in terms of shell integration, terminal multiplexing, and plugins as Neovim.

### **Neovim (with LazyVim)**:
- **Pros**:
  - **Lightweight and customizable**: Since you already use Neovim with a custom configuration, you can build a highly personalized Java and Android development environment.
  - **Familiarity**: If you're comfortable with Neovim, it's faster to navigate and code compared to adapting to Android Studio.
  - **Integration with CLI tools**: You can utilize your existing tools (e.g., `fd`, `rg`, `fzf`) for efficient searching and navigation, and combine it with tools like Gradle and Maven for dependency management.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Steeper setup**: You'll need to install and configure Android SDK, Gradle, and other Android-specific tools manually. Additionally, debugging and layout design will require external tools or plugins.
  - **No graphical layout editor**: You'll need to handle all the XML layouts and configurations manually without the visual editor provided by Android Studio.

### **JAVA_HOME Setup**:
It looks like your `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable isn't set. You can configure it by adding the following to your Fish shell configuration:

```bash
set -x JAVA_HOME /usr/libexec/java_home
```

You may also need to install **Gradle** and **Maven** for your Neovim setup if you're planning to manage project dependencies and builds manually.

- To install Gradle:
  ```bash
  brew install gradle
  ```

- To install Maven:
  ```bash
  brew install maven
  ```

### **Conclusion**:
- If you're focused on **Android development**, starting with **Android Studio** can be the easier and more efficient choice due to its built-in tools and support.
- If you prefer a **lightweight setup** and want more control over the environment, you can use Neovim but will need to configure the necessary tools manually.
