To locate the exact path of `JAVA_HOME` on your system, especially since it might have been installed via **brew** or with **Android Studio**, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Use `java_home` Utility (macOS built-in)**
   macOS provides a command-line utility to locate the Java installation directory. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   /usr/libexec/java_home
   ```

   This will return the path to the active JDK. If you want to see all installed Java versions, use:

   ```bash
   /usr/libexec/java_home -V
   ```

   The output will show a list of all installed JDKs, allowing you to pick a specific version. You can then set `JAVA_HOME` to that path:

   ```bash
   set -x JAVA_HOME /path/to/java/version
   ```

### 2. **Check for Brew Installation**
   If Java was installed via **brew**, you can find its installation path by using:

   ```bash
   brew --prefix openjdk
   ```

   This will show where the `openjdk` package is installed. If it's found, set the `JAVA_HOME` to that location:

   ```bash
   set -x JAVA_HOME $(brew --prefix openjdk)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
   ```

### 3. **Check Android Studio Installation**
   If Java came bundled with **Android Studio**, it might reside in the Android Studio directory. You can look inside the Android Studio installation folder:

   ```bash
   ls /Applications/Android\ Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home
   ```

   If you find it, you can set your `JAVA_HOME`:

   ```bash
   set -x JAVA_HOME /Applications/Android\ Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home
   ```

### 4. **Installing Maven and Gradle**
   Since Android Studio likely already has **Gradle** and **Maven**, but you want to avoid redundancy, you can check if they are already installed:

   - **Maven**: 
     Check if it's available via Android Studio or other sources:
     ```bash
     mvn -version
     ```

   - **Gradle**:
     Check if Gradle is installed:
     ```bash
     gradle -version
     ```

   If they aren't installed, or if you prefer to manage them independently with **brew**, go ahead and install them:

   - Install Maven:
     ```bash
     brew install maven
     ```

   - Install Gradle:
     ```bash
     brew install gradle
     ```

This way, you avoid redundancy while still benefiting from CLI tools and brew management.
