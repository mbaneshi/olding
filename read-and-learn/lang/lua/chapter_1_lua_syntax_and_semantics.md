### Chapter 1: Introduction to Lua Syntax and Semantics

---

#### **Overview of Lua**

- **History**: Lua was developed in 1993 at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Initially created for configuration purposes in complex systems, it has grown into a popular scripting language, particularly in game development and embedded systems.
  
- **Characteristics**:
  - Lightweight and fast, making it ideal for embedded systems and applications with limited resources.
  - Extensible, with the ability to integrate with C and other programming languages.
  - Minimalist syntax, making it easier to learn and adopt.
  - **Memory efficiency**: Lua provides automatic memory management with garbage collection.

- **Strengths**:
  - Embeddable in applications as a configuration or scripting layer.
  - Simple syntax with powerful, flexible abstractions.
  - Strong support for functional and procedural programming paradigms.

#### **Getting Started**

- **Setting up Lua Standalone**:
  - **For Mac**: Use Homebrew to install Lua:  
    ```bash
    brew install lua
    ```
  - **For Windows**: Download Lua from the official [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/download.html) website.
  - **Running Lua**:  
    Open a terminal and type `lua` to enter the interactive Lua shell.
  
- **Setting up Lua in Neovim**:
  - Neovim comes with Lua built-in. To execute Lua scripts within Neovim, use `:lua` followed by the Lua code:
    ```bash
    :lua print("Hello from Lua in Neovim!")
    ```
  - Lua configuration files for Neovim are typically located at `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. You can place your Neovim Lua scripts here.

#### **Basic Syntax**

1. **Variables**:
   - Variables in Lua are dynamically typed and can hold different types of values at different times.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     local x = 5
     local y = "Hello"
     ```

2. **Expressions**:
   - Lua supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `^` (exponentiation).
   - Example:
     ```lua
     local sum = 5 + 3
     local power = 2^3
     ```

3. **Loops**:
   - Lua supports three main loop constructs: `while`, `repeat-until`, and `for`.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     -- While loop
     local i = 1
     while i <= 5 do
       print(i)
       i = i + 1
     end
     
     -- For loop
     for i = 1, 5 do
       print(i)
     end
     ```

4. **Conditionals**:
   - Lua uses `if`, `elseif`, `else` for conditional statements.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     local x = 10
     if x > 5 then
       print("x is greater than 5")
     elseif x == 5 then
       print("x is equal to 5")
     else
       print("x is less than 5")
     end
     ```

#### **Functions**

- Functions are first-class values in Lua, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

- **Defining a function**:
  ```lua
  local function greet(name)
    print("Hello, " .. name)
  end
  ```

- **Calling a function**:
  ```lua
  greet("Lua Developer")
  ```

- **Anonymous functions**:
  ```lua
  local function add(a, b)
    return a + b
  end
  
  local sum = add(3, 5)
  ```

---

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **Closures**:
   - Lua supports closures, allowing functions to capture and store references to variables from their environment.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     function counter()
       local count = 0
       return function()
         count = count + 1
         return count
       end
     end

     local myCounter = counter()
     print(myCounter())  -- 1
     print(myCounter())  -- 2
     ```

2. **Lexical Scoping**:
   - Variables in Lua are scoped by the block they are declared in. Local variables are only accessible within the block where they are defined.

3. **Dynamic Typing**:
   - Lua does not require the explicit declaration of data types. Variables can hold values of any type, and the type can change over time.

#### **Exercises**

1. **Basic Lua Script**: Write a Lua script that prints "Hello, Lua!" to the console.
2. **Looping Structures**: Create a Lua script that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
3. **Simple Function**: Define a function that takes a number as input and prints whether it is even or odd.
4. **Closure Practice**: Write a Lua function that returns a closure which adds a number to a stored value.
