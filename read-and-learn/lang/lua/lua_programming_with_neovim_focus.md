**Prompt:**  

Design a comprehensive and hands-on Lua programming book with a focus on both fundamental and advanced Lua programming techniques, particularly emphasizing the Lua standard library and Neovim plugin development. The book should be structured to cater to beginners while offering advanced sections for experienced developers. The following key topics must be thoroughly explored:

1. **Lua Syntax and Semantics:** An introduction to Lua, its language structure, operators, and key concepts.
2. **Data Structures and the Lua Standard Library:** Exploration of Lua’s standard libraries, tables, strings, and mathematical functions.
3. **Advanced Table Manipulation and Functional Programming:** Leveraging Lua’s functional programming features, recursion, and advanced table operations.
4. **Object-Oriented Programming with Lua:** Implementing OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism using Lua.
5. **Metatables, Metamethods, and Coroutines:** Deep dive into Lua’s metatables, metamethods, and coroutine support for asynchronous tasks.
6. **Neovim Plugin Development:** Building plugins using Neovim’s Lua API, working with events, autocommands, key mappings, and other extensions.
7. **Debugging, Profiling, and Optimization for Neovim Plugins:** Techniques for identifying and resolving issues, enhancing performance, and using tools like `luacheck`.
8. **Practical Projects:** Develop real-world Neovim plugins, automate tasks, and extend Neovim's core functionality to improve developer productivity.

The book should incorporate hands-on exercises, quizzes, and project-based learning modules for practical application.
