I apologize for missing Mojo in the previous response! Here’s a look at Mojo and other programming languages and tools that focus on GPU programming and leverage CUDA or similar technologies:

### 1. **Mojo**
   - **Description:** As mentioned, Mojo is designed for high-performance computing and machine learning, combining the ease of Python with performance optimizations. It integrates well with existing Python code while providing constructs that can leverage GPUs and CUDA.

### 2. **CUDA C/C++**
   - **Description:** CUDA is NVIDIA’s parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model. It enables developers to use C, C++, and Fortran to write programs that can execute on NVIDIA GPUs. It's the standard for GPU programming.

### 3. **PyCUDA**
   - **Description:** A Python wrapper for CUDA that allows for the easy use of CUDA from Python. It provides a straightforward interface for writing GPU-accelerated code using Python syntax.

### 4. **Numba**
   - **Description:** A just-in-time compiler for Python that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code, enabling execution on GPUs using CUDA. It’s particularly useful for accelerating numerical functions in Python.

### 5. **CuPy**
   - **Description:** An open-source array library accelerated by CUDA, CuPy provides a NumPy-compatible interface for GPU-accelerated computing. It allows for writing high-performance code in Python.

### 6. **OpenCL**
   - **Description:** OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and other processors. It allows for fine-grained control over hardware resources and is widely used in parallel programming.

### 7. **Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)**
   - **Description:** MPS is a framework provided by Apple for GPU-accelerated computations on macOS and iOS. It offers highly optimized compute kernels for image processing, neural networks, and more.

### 8. **HLSL (High-Level Shading Language)**
   - **Description:** A language developed by Microsoft for programming shaders in DirectX. While primarily used in game development, it can be employed for general-purpose GPU computing.

### 9. **GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)**
   - **Description:** A C-like language used for writing shaders for the OpenGL graphics API. It can be utilized for general-purpose computing tasks as well, especially in graphics applications.

### 10. **TensorFlow with CUDA**
   - **Description:** While TensorFlow is primarily a high-level machine learning library, it can be optimized for GPU computations through CUDA. TensorFlow's ability to leverage CUDA allows for high-performance training of deep learning models.

### 11. **Chapel**
   - **Description:** A parallel programming language that includes support for various architectures, including GPUs. Chapel focuses on high productivity and performance, making it suitable for scientific computing.

### 12. **OpenACC**
   - **Description:** A set of compiler directives for C, C++, and Fortran that simplifies the process of parallelizing code for GPUs. It allows developers to add annotations to their code to instruct the compiler to offload tasks to GPUs.

### 13. **RAPIDS**
   - **Description:** An open-source suite of libraries for GPU-accelerated data science and analytics, built on CUDA. It provides Python interfaces for data manipulation and machine learning.

### Conclusion

These languages and frameworks emphasize high-performance computing and GPU acceleration, making them valuable for applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analytics.
