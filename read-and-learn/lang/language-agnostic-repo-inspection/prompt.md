Here's a prompt you can feed into ChatGPT to get a comprehensive plan for your project:

---

**Prompt:**

We have a GitHub repository that we need to explore and analyze deeply. The code in the repository is arbitrary, and we donâ€™t know the language. We need to systematically:

1. Identify the language of the repository.
2. Extract information about:

   - The modules it contains.
   - The folder and file structure.
   - The classes and functions it defines.
   - The variables and their types.
   - The design patterns and system architecture it utilizes.

3. Once the repository is analyzed, we need to:

   - Define a database schema or advanced type definitions to represent the extracted data.
   - Query the repository information using this schema for easy access.

4. Finally, we want to:
   - Present all this information on a website with the best possible UX design.
   - Optimize the codebase for performance and security by porting it to a modern, high-performance language.

For context, think of a scenario where we clone a large codebase, like the Linux kernel, and perform all the steps above. We also want to understand how the system works, identify optimizations, and present the findings for educational purposes.

What I need from you is:

- A high-level plan.
- The prerequisites and tools we need for this project.
- A strategic approach to analyzing the repository.
- How to structure the schema and database for querying.
- Suggestions for optimizing and porting the code to a more secure and performant language.
- Best practices for designing a website for presenting this information with an emphasis on UX.

Please provide a detailed breakdown of these steps.
