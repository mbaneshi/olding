    - Display results on the terminal.
- **Sprint 2**: Extract classes, functions, and variables.
  - Tasks:
    - Parse the codebase using `ast`.
    - Design and populate the database with extracted information.
- **Sprint 3**: Build the basic web interface.
  - Tasks:
    - Set up Flask/Django project.
    - Implement API endpoints for querying the repository data.
    - Use Bootstrap/Tailwind for a responsive UI.
- **Sprint 4**: Polish MVP and prepare pitch materials.
  - Tasks:
    - Finalize UI.
    - Add performance profiling.
    - Create investor presentation.

### 5. **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**

**Purpose**: Break down project features into actionable items that the development team can work on.

**Example User Stories**:

- **Story**: As a user, I want to detect the language of a repository so that I can understand what programming languages are used.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system correctly identifies the primary language of each file.
    - A summary of all detected languages is presented.

- **Story**: As a user, I want to view the structure of the repository so that I can understand its organization.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system displays the full file/folder hierarchy.
    - Users can filter by file types (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.cpp`).

- **Story**: As an investor, I want to see a demo of the repository analyzer so that I can understand its potential.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - A fully functional demo is available with an intuitive UI.
    - It shows key metrics like languages, structure, and classes.

### 6. **Risk Management Plan**

**Purpose**: Identifies potential risks to the project and outlines mitigation strategies.

**Contents**:

- **Risk**: Scope creep delaying MVP delivery.
  - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to the MVP scope document.
- **Risk**: Difficulty in extracting information from multi-language repositories.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms to handle unknown file types gracefully.
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large codebases.
  - **Mitigation**: Use profiling tools early in the development cycle.
- **Risk**: Investor disinterest if MVP isn’t polished.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate time for UI/UX refinement before the investor pitch.
