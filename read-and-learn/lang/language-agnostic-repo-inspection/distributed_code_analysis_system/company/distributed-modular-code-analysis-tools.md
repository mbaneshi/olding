### 2. **Semmle (GitHub CodeQL)**

**Capabilities:**

- **CodeQL Analysis**: CodeQL, now part of GitHub, enables **deep code analysis** to identify vulnerabilities, code patterns, and anti-patterns. It allows you to write custom queries in the **CodeQL query language** to extract specific insights.
- **Security Vulnerability Detection**: CodeQL is widely recognized for its ability to detect **security vulnerabilities** in large codebases across languages like Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.
- **Design Pattern Detection**: Custom CodeQL queries can be written to detect specific **design patterns** in codebases.
- **Cross-Language Analysis**: CodeQL's ability to analyze **multi-language codebases** makes it a good fit for your need to analyze different languages and extract meaningful insights.
- **Open-Source Community**: CodeQL’s powerful query capabilities are open-source and widely used within the security community.

**Open-Source Tools:**

- **CodeQL CLI**: An open-source command-line tool that can be integrated into your system for local codebase analysis.
- **CodeQL Libraries**: Open-source libraries of pre-built queries available from GitHub for common security vulnerabilities, design patterns, and more.

**Strengths for Your Project:**

- Offers **highly customizable queries** for deep code analysis, enabling you to detect both **security vulnerabilities** and **design patterns** across languages.
- Integrates well with **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and can be extended for **automated refactoring** and pattern detection.

### 3. **Checkmarx**

**Capabilities:**

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Checkmarx is focused on security, helping to identify vulnerabilities, weak spots, and patterns in codebases.
- **Design Pattern Detection**: Through its **SAST capabilities**, Checkmarx can be adapted to detect design patterns in codebases, although this is typically more focused on security.
- **Code Relationship Mapping**: It offers tools to understand relationships between modules and how changes in one part of the code affect the rest of the application.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Checkmarx integrates well with CI/CD tools for continuous analysis and early vulnerability detection.
- **API Integration**: Checkmarx offers APIs for integrating into custom systems.

**Open-Source Tools:**

- Checkmarx primarily provides **commercial services**, but their **open-source scanning tools** are available for security vulnerability detection. However, Checkmarx’s core focus is on enterprise-level security and vulnerability scanning.

**Strengths for Your Project:**

- Good for **security analysis** and vulnerability detection, but may require integration with other tools for full codebase analysis and relationship mapping.
- Can complement tools like CodeQL by focusing on security vulnerabilities and detecting specific patterns.

### 4. **JetBrains**

**Capabilities:**

- **Code Quality Analysis**: JetBrains offers **IntelliJ IDEA** and **other IDEs** that provide **real-time code analysis**, suggesting improvements, finding bugs, and calculating code complexity.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: JetBrains IDEs have a robust plugin ecosystem that can integrate additional code analysis tools, such as SonarQube or custom static analysis tools.
- **Code Refactoring**: IntelliJ IDEA offers advanced refactoring tools, including automated refactorings like renaming variables, extracting methods, and converting between design patterns.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Supports multiple languages, including Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and more.

**Open-Source Tools:**

- **JetBrains Code With Me**: A collaborative tool that can be open-sourced for collaborative coding and analysis.
- **IntelliJ Platform SDK**: JetBrains provides open-source SDKs for building custom IDE extensions or plugins, which can be useful for integrating additional code analysis functionality.

**Strengths for Your Project:**

- **Real-time code quality analysis** and **refactoring** suggestions directly within the IDE.
- The JetBrains ecosystem supports **multi-language codebases**, and the open SDK offers possibilities for **extending code analysis** through plugins.
