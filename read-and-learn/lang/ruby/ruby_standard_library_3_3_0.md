The Ruby Standard Library in version 3.3.0 offers a rich set of built-in libraries, providing core functionality without needing to install extra gems. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the different categories and their utilities:

### 1. **Core Libraries**:
   - **`String`, `Array`, `Hash`, `Range`, `Regexp`**: 
     - These are the foundational data structures in Ruby.
     - **String** handles text manipulation.
     - **Array** is an ordered collection of elements.
     - **Hash** stores key-value pairs.
     - **Range** represents sequences.
     - **Regexp** is used for regular expressions and pattern matching.

### 2. **I/O and File Handling**:
   - **`IO`, `File`, `Dir`, `Pathname`**:
     - **IO** serves as the base class for dealing with input/output streams.
     - **File** is for file operations, such as reading and writing.
     - **Dir** handles directory operations.
     - **Pathname** provides an object-oriented interface for manipulating file paths.

### 3. **Date and Time Manipulation**:
   - **`Date`, `Time`, `DateTime`**:
     - These libraries manage different types of date and time handling.
     - **Date** focuses on date-only data, while **Time** handles time with or without dates. **DateTime** combines both.

### 4. **Threading and Concurrency**:
   - **`Thread`, `Mutex`, `Queue`, `ConditionVariable`**:
     - **Thread** enables concurrent execution of code.
     - **Mutex** provides mutual exclusion for thread synchronization.
     - **Queue** is a thread-safe FIFO queue.
     - **ConditionVariable** enables threads to wait for specific conditions to be met.

### 5. **Networking**:
   - **`Socket`, `IPSocket`, `TCPServer`, `UDPSocket`, `URI`, `Net::HTTP`, `OpenSSL`**:
     - **Socket** provides low-level networking, with **TCPServer** and **UDPSocket** being specific for TCP/UDP connections.
     - **Net::HTTP** handles HTTP requests, while **OpenSSL** adds encryption capabilities.

### 6. **Text Processing**:
   - **`CSV`, `JSON`, `YAML`, `REXML`**:
     - These handle different data formats:
       - **CSV** deals with comma-separated values.
       - **JSON** parses and generates JSON data.
       - **YAML** allows human-readable data serialization.
       - **REXML** supports XML parsing.

### 7. **Math and Number Handling**:
   - **`Math`, `Complex`, `BigDecimal`, `Rational`**:
     - **Math** includes mathematical methods.
     - **BigDecimal** provides high-precision decimal arithmetic.
     - **Complex** and **Rational** deal with complex and rational numbers, respectively.

### 8. **System Interaction**:
   - **`Process`, `Signal`, `Etc`**:
     - **Process** controls the execution of system processes.
     - **Signal** manages system signals (like interrupts).
     - **Etc** gives access to user and group information on the system.

### 9. **Error Handling and Debugging**:
   - **`Exception`, `Signal`, `TracePoint`, `Logger`**:
     - **Exception** is the base class for all exceptions, enabling structured error handling.
     - **TracePoint** helps track code execution for debugging.
     - **Logger** provides a simple logging utility for applications.

### 10. **Miscellaneous Utilities**:
   - **`Digest`, `Set`, `Zlib`, `Forwardable`, `Singleton`**:
     - **Digest** provides hashing utilities.
     - **Set** implements a mathematical set.
     - **Zlib** offers compression features.
     - **Forwardable** supports delegation design patterns.
     - **Singleton** allows the creation of classes with a single instance.

### Additional Utilities:
   - **`Benchmark`**: Measures performance of code.
   - **`OptParse`**: Simplifies command-line option parsing.
   - **`OpenStruct`**: Provides flexible, dynamic objects.

Ruby 3.3.0 also brings performance enhancements, particularly in method calls like `Array#each`, and introduces refinements in handling keyword arguments and error messages.
