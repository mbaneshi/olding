### Chapter 6: **Architectural Patterns in C#**

Architectural patterns are key to designing scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications. This chapter covers various architectural patterns commonly applied in C# applications, focusing on their use cases, benefits, and how to implement them effectively.

---

#### 6.1 Layered Architecture

**Layered architecture** is one of the most common architectural patterns in software development. It organizes the application into distinct layers, each responsible for specific concerns, such as presentation, business logic, and data access.

##### **6.1.1 Common Layers:**

1. **Presentation Layer (UI):** Handles user interaction and presentation logic.
2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** Contains the core application logic.
3. **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Manages access to the database or external services.
4. **Infrastructure Layer:** Deals with cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, or messaging.

##### **6.1.2 Example of Layered Architecture in C#**

```csharp
// Business Logic Layer (BLL)
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;

    public OrderService(IOrderRepository orderRepository)
    {
        _orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public void PlaceOrder(Order order)
    {
        // Business logic to validate order
        _orderRepository.Save(order);
    }
}

// Data Access Layer (DAL)
public class OrderRepository : IOrderRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public OrderRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public void Save(Order order)
    {
        _context.Orders.Add(order);
        _context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```

##### **6.1.3 Benefits and Drawbacks:**

- **Benefits:**
  - Separation of concerns
  - Easier testing and maintainability
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Can introduce performance overhead due to layer transitions
  - May lead to over-engineering for simple applications

---

#### 6.2 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** emphasizes focusing on the business domain and its logic. It promotes designing software around the core business concepts and entities.

##### **6.2.1 Core Concepts:**

- **Entities:** Objects with a unique identity (e.g., `Order`, `Customer`).
- **Value Objects:** Immutable objects that donâ€™t have an identity (e.g., `Address`, `Money`).
- **Aggregates:** A group of entities that are treated as a single unit.
- **Repositories:** Interfaces for persisting aggregates to the database.

##### **6.2.2 DDD Example:**

```csharp
// Entity
public class Order
{
    public int OrderId { get; private set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; private set; }

    public Order(List<OrderItem> items)
    {
        Items = items;
    }

    public void AddItem(OrderItem item)
    {
        Items.Add(item);
    }
}

// Repository
public interface IOrderRepository
{
    void Save(Order order);
}
```

##### **6.2.3 Benefits and Drawbacks:**

- **Benefits:**
  - Aligns software with the business domain
  - Enhances collaboration between developers and domain experts
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Steep learning curve
  - May require more upfront design effort

---

#### 6.3 Microservices Architecture

**Microservices** break down an application into small, independently deployable services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

##### **6.3.1 Core Principles of Microservices:**

- **Single Responsibility:** Each microservice should focus on a specific business capability.
- **Decentralized Data Management:** Each service manages its own data store.
- **Independent Deployment:** Services can be deployed independently without impacting other services.

##### **6.3.2 Example of a Microservice in C#:**

Using **ASP.NET Core** to create a simple microservice:

```csharp
// In OrderService
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;

    public OrderController(IOrderService orderService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult PlaceOrder(OrderDto orderDto)
    {
        _orderService.ProcessOrder(orderDto);
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

##### **6.3.3 Benefits and Drawbacks:**

- **Benefits:**
  - Scalability: Services can be scaled independently.
  - Flexibility: Allows the use of different technologies for different services.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Complexity: Managing multiple services introduces operational complexity.
  - Increased Latency: Services must communicate over the network, which can lead to slower response times.

#### 6.4 Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** uses events to communicate between services or components, allowing for loosely coupled systems that can react to changes or triggers.

##### **6.4.1 Core Concepts:**

- **Events:** Messages that represent a significant change in state or an action.
- **Event Producers:** Components that publish events when something important happens.
- **Event Consumers:** Components that subscribe to and react to events.

##### **6.4.2 Example of Event-Driven Design in C#:**

Using **MediatR** to handle events within a C# application:

```csharp
// Define Event
public class OrderPlacedEvent : INotification
{
    public Order Order { get; }

    public OrderPlacedEvent(Order order)
    {
        Order = order;
    }
}

// Event Handler
public class SendEmailOnOrderPlaced : INotificationHandler<OrderPlacedEvent>
{
    public Task Handle(OrderPlacedEvent notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Send email logic here
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

##### **6.4.3 Benefits and Drawbacks:**

- **Benefits:**
  - Decoupling: Services/components do not need to know about each other.
  - Scalability: Events can be processed asynchronously, improving scalability.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Eventual Consistency: Events may not be processed immediately, leading to delays.
  - Debugging Complexity: Tracing the flow of events through the system can be challenging.
