### Chapter 2: **Advanced C# Language Features**

---

#### 2.1 Generics in Depth

Generics allow you to define a class, method, delegate, or interface with a placeholder for a type that is specified when it is instantiated or invoked. This allows for **type safety** and **code reusability** while avoiding the overhead of casting or boxing.

---

##### **2.1.1 Generic Classes and Methods**

You’ve likely used generics when working with collections like `List<T>`, but you can also create your own generic classes or methods.

**Example of a Generic Class:**

```csharp
public class Box<T>
{
    private T _value;
    
    public Box(T value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }
    
    public T GetValue()
    {
        return _value;
    }
    
    public void SetValue(T value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }
}
```

This class can now store any data type while maintaining type safety:

```csharp
Box<int> intBox = new Box<int>(10);
Console.WriteLine(intBox.GetValue()); // Output: 10

Box<string> strBox = new Box<string>("Hello");
Console.WriteLine(strBox.GetValue()); // Output: Hello
```

**Generic Methods:**

Generic methods work in a similar way, allowing methods to be flexible with types.

```csharp
public T GetMax<T>(T a, T b) where T : IComparable
{
    return a.CompareTo(b) > 0 ? a : b;
}
```

This method can be used with any type that implements `IComparable`, such as integers, strings, etc.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(GetMax(10, 20)); // Output: 20
Console.WriteLine(GetMax("apple", "orange")); // Output: orange
```

---

##### **2.1.2 Constraints in Generics**

To further control what types can be used in your generic classes or methods, you can define **constraints**. Common constraints include:

- **`where T : struct`**: Ensures `T` is a value type.
- **`where T : class`**: Ensures `T` is a reference type.
- **`where T : new()`**: Ensures `T` has a parameterless constructor.
- **`where T : BaseClass`**: Ensures `T` inherits from a specific base class.
- **`where T : IInterface`**: Ensures `T` implements a particular interface.

Example with multiple constraints:

```csharp
public class Repository<T> where T : class, new()
{
    public T CreateInstance()
    {
        return new T();
    }
}
```

---

##### **2.1.3 Covariance and Contravariance**

Covariance and contravariance apply to **generic interfaces** and **delegates**, allowing you to use more derived or base types for generic type parameters.

- **Covariance** allows a more derived type to be used than originally specified.
  
  Covariant generic interfaces are marked with the `out` keyword. Example:

  ```csharp
  public interface ICovariant<out T> { }
  
  ICovariant<object> obj = new ICovariant<string>();
  ```

- **Contravariance** allows a more generic (or base) type to be used than originally specified.

  Contravariant generic interfaces are marked with the `in` keyword:

  ```csharp
  public interface IContravariant<in T> { }
  
  IContravariant<string> str = new IContravariant<object>();
  ```

Covariance applies to output positions (e.g., return values), while contravariance applies to input positions (e.g., method parameters).

---

#### 2.2 LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)

LINQ allows you to query collections using SQL-like syntax directly in C#. It’s built on **deferred execution**, **type inference**, and **extension methods**, making it a powerful tool for querying, transforming, and manipulating data collections.

---

##### **2.2.1 LINQ Syntax**

LINQ has two main syntaxes: **query syntax** and **method syntax**. The query syntax is similar to SQL, while the method syntax uses extension methods like `Where`, `Select`, and `OrderBy`.

**Query Syntax Example:**

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

var evenNumbers = from num in numbers
                  where num % 2 == 0
                  select num;

foreach (var n in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(n); // Output: 2, 4
}
```

**Method Syntax Example:**

```csharp
var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).Select(num => num);

foreach (var n in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(n); // Output: 2, 4
}
```

---

##### **2.2.2 Deferred Execution**

One of the key features of LINQ is deferred execution. The query is not executed until you actually **iterate** over the result, which can improve performance.

Example:

```csharp
var query = numbers.Where(n => n > 3);
Console.WriteLine(query.Count()); // Execution happens here
```

---

##### **2.2.3 LINQ to Objects, SQL, and XML**

LINQ can work on **in-memory collections** (`LINQ to Objects`), **databases** (`LINQ to SQL` or `Entity Framework`), and even **XML documents** (`LINQ to XML`), making it a very versatile tool.

---

#### 2.3 Async and Await Patterns

The **async** and **await** keywords are central to C#'s **asynchronous programming** model. They allow you to write asynchronous code that is both readable and efficient. Under the hood, asynchronous operations don't block the main thread, allowing applications to remain responsive.

---

##### **2.3.1 Asynchronous Methods**

An **async method** is a method marked with the `async` keyword, which enables the use of the `await` keyword within the method to handle asynchronous calls.

**Example of Async Method:**

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    string data = await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
    return data;
}
```

Here, `GetDataAsync` does not block the calling thread while waiting for the HTTP request to complete, allowing the application to continue running.

---

##### **2.3.2 Handling Asynchronous Tasks with `Task` and `ValueTask`**

In C#, the **Task** class represents a unit of work that may complete asynchronously. `ValueTask` is a more recent addition that helps reduce memory allocations when dealing with short-lived or synchronous operations.

- Use `Task` for long-running or complex asynchronous methods.
- Use `ValueTask` when you expect a method to complete synchronously most of the time but want to keep the option for asynchronous execution.

**Example with ValueTask:**

```csharp
public ValueTask<int> GetNumberAsync(bool immediate)
{
    if (immediate)
    {
        return new ValueTask<int>(42); // Completes synchronously
    }
    else
    {
        return new ValueTask<int>(Task.Run(() => 42)); // Completes asynchronously
    }
}
```

---

#### 2.4 Pattern Matching

C# has introduced powerful **pattern matching** capabilities, which allow for more expressive control flow and simplify type checks and destructuring.

---

##### **2.4.1 Switch Expressions**

Switch expressions offer a concise syntax for matching on values and types.

**Example:**

```csharp
int number = 3;
string result = number switch
{
    1 => "One",
    2 => "Two",
    3 => "Three",
    _ => "Unknown"
};

Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: Three
```

---

##### **2.4.2 Property and Positional Patterns**

Property patterns allow you to match on properties of an object.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

var person = new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 };

string description = person switch
{
    { Age: < 18 } => "Child",
    { Age: >= 18 } => "Adult",
    _ => "Unknown"
};
```

---

#### 2.5 Span<T> and Memory<T> for Performance

**Span<T>** and **Memory<T>** are types used for working with memory in a highly efficient manner, helping to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

Span is typically used for stack-allocated memory, while Memory works with heap-allocated data.

---

##### **2.5.1 Span<T> Example:**

```csharp
Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
numbers[0] = 42;
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]); // Output: 42
```

Using `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` improves performance for scenarios where you manipulate slices of arrays or memory buffers directly.

---

.6 Reflection and Dynamic Programming**

Reflection allows you to **inspect assemblies**, **types**, **methods**, and **properties** at runtime. It’s powerful but comes with some performance trade-offs.

**Example of Using Reflection:**

```csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);
MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("GetName");
object result = method.Invoke(new Person(), null);
```

Reflection is also used for creating **dynamic types** and invoking methods at runtime. However, it should be used carefully due to performance costs.
