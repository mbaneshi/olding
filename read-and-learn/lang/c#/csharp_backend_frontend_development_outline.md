---

### **1. Introduction to ASP.NET Core**
   - **Overview of ASP.NET Core**: Cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based web apps.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Performance: High-speed request handling.
     - Cross-platform: Run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
     - Modular and lightweight architecture.
   - **ASP.NET Core vs. .NET Framework**: Differences in performance, deployment, and modularity.
   - **Getting Started**:
     - Setting up a new ASP.NET Core project.
     - Overview of the project structure.
     - ASP.NET Core in MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
   
---

### **2. Building RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core**
   - **RESTful Architecture**: Key principles of REST (statelessness, resource-based, use of HTTP methods).
   - **Setting Up Controllers**:
     - Understanding the `Controller` class and action methods.
     - Routing in ASP.NET Core.
     - Defining routes with attribute-based routing.
   - **Handling HTTP Methods**:
     - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
     - Using `HttpGet`, `HttpPost`, `HttpPut`, and `HttpDelete` attributes.
   - **Request and Response Handling**:
     - Model binding.
     - Validation with `DataAnnotations`.
     - Returning status codes and custom responses.
   - **Consuming APIs**: Brief overview of how clients can consume the APIs built.

### **3. Dependency Injection (DI) and Middleware**
   - **Understanding Dependency Injection**:
     - What is Dependency Injection (DI) and its importance in ASP.NET Core?
     - How DI is integrated into ASP.NET Core's architecture.
     - Setting up services in the `Startup.cs` class.
     - Lifetimes of services: `AddSingleton`, `AddScoped`, `AddTransient`.
   - **Building Middleware**:
     - What is Middleware? How requests flow through middleware.
     - Built-in middleware (e.g., `UseRouting`, `UseAuthentication`, `UseAuthorization`).
     - Creating custom middleware for logging, authentication, etc.

### **4. Working with Databases using Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
   - **Introduction to Entity Framework Core**:
     - What is EF Core? Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET Core.
     - Advantages of using EF Core: Code-first, migrations, LINQ queries.
   - **Setting Up Database Context**:
     - Creating the `DbContext` class and defining models.
     - Configuring the database connection in `appsettings.json`.
   - **CRUD Operations**:
     - Adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting data using EF Core.
     - Working with `DbSet<T>` to represent database tables.
   - **Migrations**:
     - Generating migrations for database schema updates.
     - Applying migrations to update the database.
   - **LINQ Queries**:
     - Filtering and querying data using LINQ (Language Integrated Query).

### **5. Blazor: Full-Stack Development Using C#**
   - **Introduction to Blazor**:
     - What is Blazor? A framework for building interactive web UIs using C#.
     - Client-side (Blazor WebAssembly) vs. Server-side Blazor.
     - Blazor’s role in replacing JavaScript for frontend development.
   - **Setting Up a Blazor Project**:
     - Blazor project structure and key components.
     - Building a simple Blazor app.
   - **Components in Blazor**:
     - Creating Blazor components using Razor syntax.
     - Component lifecycle methods.
     - Data binding in Blazor: One-way and two-way binding.
     - Reusable components and parameter passing.
   - **State Management**:
     - Managing state in Blazor applications (e.g., `CascadingValue`, services).
     - Persisting state across sessions.
   - **Routing in Blazor**:
     - Defining routes and navigation between pages in Blazor.

---

### **6. Interaction between Blazor Components**
   - **Component Communication**:
     - Passing data between parent and child components using parameters.
     - Event callbacks for component-to-component communication.
   - **Reusable Components**:
     - Building generic components for reuse.
     - Template-based components for handling different data types.
   - **Advanced Features**:
     - Dynamic content rendering with `RenderFragment`.
     - Integration of third-party libraries in Blazor components.

---

### **7. C# vs JavaScript for Frontend Development**
   - **Blazor (C#) vs. JavaScript**:
     - Comparison of performance, flexibility, and development experience.
     - Blazor as an alternative to JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue).
   - **Pros and Cons of Using C# for Frontend**:
     - **Pros**:
       - Use of C# and .NET ecosystem across both backend and frontend.
       - Strong typing, better tooling support in Visual Studio and VSCode.
     - **Cons**:
       - Limited ecosystem compared to JavaScript.
       - Browser compatibility and performance considerations (especially for Blazor WebAssembly).
   - **Interoperability with JavaScript**:
     - Blazor’s JS Interop feature for calling JavaScript functions from C# and vice versa.
     - When and why to integrate JavaScript into Blazor projects.

---

### **Summary:**
This outline covers the fundamentals of backend development using **ASP.NET Core** for building RESTful APIs, implementing dependency injection, working with databases through **Entity Framework Core**, and delves into **full-stack development** using C# through **Blazor**, a framework that enables developers to write both backend and frontend code in C#. It also compares C# with JavaScript for frontend development.
