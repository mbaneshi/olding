### Part 3: Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await

#### Chapter 6: Introduction to Asynchronous Programming

1. **The Need for Asynchronous Programming**
   - Explain why asynchronous programming is essential for modern applications (e.g., responsive UIs, high-performance web servers).
   - Discuss traditional blocking I/O vs. non-blocking I/O and how async programming addresses the limitations of blocking I/O.

2. **The Evolution of Asynchronous Patterns in C#**
   - Trace the history of asynchronous programming in C#: from callbacks and `BeginInvoke/EndInvoke` patterns to the `Task`-based asynchronous programming model.
   - Introduce the `async` and `await` keywords introduced in C# 5.0, explaining their role in simplifying asynchronous code.

3. **Basic Async/Await Syntax**
   - Describe the syntax for creating asynchronous methods using the `async` modifier and the `await` operator.
   - Explain `Task` and `Task<T>` as core concepts in asynchronous programming.
   - Hands-on example: Create a basic asynchronous method that reads data from a file without blocking the main thread.

#### Chapter 7: Writing Asynchronous Code Using Async and Await

1. **Using `Task` and `Task<T>` in C#**
   - Explain the difference between `void`, `Task`, and `Task<T>` return types for asynchronous methods.
   - Discuss the rules for using `async` and `await` effectively, including avoiding blocking calls like `.Result` or `.Wait()`.
   - Hands-on example: Write a simple asynchronous web scraper using `HttpClient` to download web pages in parallel.

2. **Exception Handling in Asynchronous Code**
   - Explain how exceptions propagate in asynchronous methods and how to catch them using `try-catch` blocks.
   - Demonstrate how to handle multiple exceptions with `Task.WhenAll`.
   - Hands-on example: Create a file-processing application that reads multiple files asynchronously and catches exceptions for each file read.

3. **Performance Considerations and Best Practices**
   - Discuss common performance pitfalls (e.g., using `async void`, overusing `ConfigureAwait(false)`, blocking the main thread).
   - Introduce tools like `Task.Run` and `Parallel.ForEach` for running CPU-bound work asynchronously.
   - Hands-on example: Implement a CPU-intensive image processing operation using asynchronous techniques to avoid blocking.

#### Chapter 8: Advanced Asynchronous Patterns

1. **Asynchronous Streams with `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`**
   - Explain the concept of asynchronous streams and how they differ from traditional `IEnumerable<T>`.
   - Describe when to use asynchronous streams (e.g., processing data as it becomes available, real-time data feeds).
   - Hands-on example: Build a data stream that reads from a network socket asynchronously and processes data as it arrives.

2. **Using `ConfigureAwait` for Fine-Grained Control**
   - Explain how `ConfigureAwait(false)` can improve performance by not capturing the synchronization context.
   - Discuss scenarios where you should or should not use `ConfigureAwait`.
   - Hands-on example: Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in a library method to improve performance and avoid deadlocks in UI applications.

3. **Implementing a Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Create an asynchronous pipeline that processes data in stages (e.g., reading, transforming, and outputting data).
   - Hands-on example: Build a real-time data analytics pipeline that reads data from a sensor, processes it, and displays the results.

4. **Parallelism vs. Concurrency in Asynchronous Code**
   - Explain the difference between parallelism (executing multiple tasks at the same time) and concurrency (managing multiple tasks but not necessarily executing them simultaneously).
   - Show how to combine parallelism and asynchronous programming in C# using `Task.WhenAll` and `Parallel.ForEachAsync`.
   - Hands-on example: Implement an application that performs parallel data processing with asynchronous I/O operations.

#### Chapter 9: Task Scheduling and Custom Awaitables

1. **Controlling Task Scheduling and Synchronization Contexts**
   - Explain the default task scheduling behavior in C# and how to control it with custom schedulers.
   - Discuss synchronization contexts and their role in UI applications.
   - Hands-on example: Create a custom task scheduler that prioritizes certain tasks based on user-defined criteria.

2. **Creating Custom Awaitable Types**
   - Explain how to create custom awaitable types by implementing the `GetAwaiter` method.
   - Discuss scenarios where custom awaitables can simplify complex asynchronous workflows.
   - Hands-on example: Build a custom awaitable that adds a delay to simulate network latency in an application.

3. **Asynchronous Coordination Primitives**
   - Introduce coordination primitives like `SemaphoreSlim`, `CountdownEvent`, and `Barrier` for managing asynchronous workflows.
   - Hands-on example: Use `SemaphoreSlim` to limit concurrent access to a shared resource in an asynchronous application.

#### Chapter 6-9 Hands-On Examples and Exercises

1. **Exercise 1: Building an Asynchronous Web Scraper**
   - Create an application that scrapes multiple web pages concurrently, handles exceptions, and saves the content to files.

2. **Exercise 2: Implementing a Real-Time Data Stream Processor**
   - Develop an application that reads real-time data from a source (e.g., stock prices) using `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`, processes the data, and displays updates.

3. **Exercise 3: Custom Awaitable for Simulated Latency**
   - Build a custom awaitable class that simulates network latency and integrate it into an existing application to observe the behavior.

4. **Exercise 4: Asynchronous Task Scheduling Application**
   - Implement a task scheduling system where tasks are prioritized and executed asynchronously based on certain rules.

5. **Exercise 5: Creating a Data Processing Pipeline with Asynchronous Stages**
   - Develop a multi-stage data processing pipeline that processes data in several asynchronous stages, ensuring efficient memory and CPU usage.
