---

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. It is designed to enable developers to build web applications, services, and APIs that can run on various platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. In this chapter, we will introduce ASP.NET Core, discuss its architecture, and guide you through setting up your first ASP.NET Core project.

In this chapter, we will cover:
- Overview of web application development with ASP.NET Core.
- Key architecture and features of ASP.NET Core.
- Setting up your first ASP.NET Core project.

#### **Overview of Web Application Development with ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core has emerged as a modern solution for web development due to its focus on performance, flexibility, and ease of deployment. It allows you to build:
- Web applications that serve HTML pages.
- Web APIs that provide data services for client applications.
- Real-time applications using SignalR.
- Microservices and distributed applications.

ASP.NET Core embraces modularity, enabling developers to include only the features they need and replace default implementations with custom services as required. It's built on the `Kestrel` web server, which is lightweight and highly efficient.

##### **Key Advantages of ASP.NET Core**:
1. **Cross-platform**: Develop and run applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. **High-performance**: ASP.NET Core is optimized for high-performance and scalability.
3. **Unified Framework**: A single framework to build both web APIs and web applications.
4. **Cloud Integration**: Full integration with modern cloud services such as Microsoft Azure.
5. **Modular**: Include only the components you need, which makes applications lightweight.

#### **ASP.NET Core Architecture**

The ASP.NET Core architecture consists of several key components that allow you to build and run web applications efficiently. These components include:

1. **Hosting**: ASP.NET Core uses a built-in web server called `Kestrel`. Applications are hosted inside a host, which is responsible for managing the app lifecycle, configuration, and web server setup.
2. **Middleware Pipeline**: A series of request-handling components that process HTTP requests and responses. Middleware components can handle authentication, logging, static files, routing, and more.
3. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: ASP.NET Core has built-in dependency injection to manage the lifecycle of services and inject dependencies into application components.
4. **Routing**: ASP.NET Core uses a flexible routing system to map URLs to controllers, APIs, or views. Routing enables you to define custom URL patterns and map them to the appropriate handlers.
5. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: ASP.NET Core supports the MVC pattern for building web applications. MVC separates the application logic into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic).

**High-Level ASP.NET Core Application Structure:**

#### **Key Features of ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core is packed with features designed to make it easier to build secure, scalable, and maintainable applications. Some of the key features include:

- **Modular Middleware**: ASP.NET Core applications are composed of middleware components that handle each request and response. Middleware can be added, removed, or replaced to customize the request processing pipeline.
- **Unified APIs for MVC and Web APIs**: A unified model for building both web UIs and web APIs, using controllers, routes, and filters.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: ASP.NET Core supports asynchronous programming via `async` and `await`, which helps improve the scalability and performance of applications.
- **Dependency Injection**: ASP.NET Core comes with built-in support for dependency injection (DI) to inject dependencies into services and controllers, promoting loose coupling.
- **Configuration and Options**: It uses a flexible configuration system that can load settings from JSON files, environment variables, and more.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: ASP.NET Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, supporting the .NET Core runtime.

#### **Setting Up Your First ASP.NET Core Project**

Let's walk through setting up your first ASP.NET Core project step by step. In this section, we'll cover installing the necessary tools, creating a new project, and understanding its basic structure.

##### **Step 1: Install .NET SDK**

If you haven't installed the .NET SDK yet, you can download and install it from the official [Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). Make sure you install the latest version of the SDK.

To verify the installation, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

##### **Step 2: Create a New ASP.NET Core Project**

To create a new ASP.NET Core project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new webapp -o MyFirstAspNetApp
```

This command creates a new ASP.NET Core web application using the Razor Pages template and places it in a folder named `MyFirstAspNetApp`.

After the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd MyFirstAspNetApp
```

##### **Step 3: Explore the Project Structure**

Once the project is generated, you'll see the following basic folder structure:

```text
MyFirstAspNetApp/
│
├── Controllers/         // Controllers for handling HTTP requests (in MVC pattern)
├── Pages/               // Razor Pages (for page-based apps)
├── wwwroot/             // Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
├── Program.cs           // Main entry point for the app
├── Startup.cs           // Configures middleware, services, and routing
├── appsettings.json     // Configuration settings (e.g., connection strings)
```

##### **Step 4: Run the Application**

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Once the app is running, open a browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001`. You'll see the default ASP.NET Core welcome page, confirming that your application is running successfully.

#### **Understanding the Main Components of an ASP.NET Core App**

Now, let's explore the key components of an ASP.NET Core project.

1. **`Program.cs`**: This is the main entry point for the application, responsible for building and running the web host.
   
   **Example: Program.cs**
   
   ```csharp
   public class Program
   {
       public static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
       }
   
       public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
           Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
               .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
               {
                   webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
               });
   }
   ```

2. **`Startup.cs`**: This file configures the services and the HTTP request pipeline for the application. It contains two important methods:
   - `ConfigureServices()`: Registers application services like database contexts, logging, and authentication.
   - `Configure()`: Defines the middleware pipeline used to process incoming HTTP requests.

   **Example: Startup.cs**
   
   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           services.AddRazorPages();
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           if (env.IsDevelopment())
           {
               app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
           }
           else
           {
               app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
               app.UseHsts();
           }
   
           app.UseHttpsRedirection();
           app.UseStaticFiles();
           app.UseRouting();
           app.UseAuthorization();

           app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
           {
               endpoints.MapRazorPages();
           });
       }
   }
   ```

3. **`appsettings.json`**: This file contains configuration settings like database connection strings, logging configurations, and app-specific settings. ASP.NET Core automatically reads and loads this file during startup.

   **Example: appsettings.json**
   
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
       }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*"
   }
   ```
