### **2. Project Setup and Workflow**

#### **2.1 Initial Setup**

##### **Svelte App Setup**

The Svelte app forms the core UI, and it’s relatively simple to set up. Since we are targeting a Chrome Extension, the UI will primarily exist in the **popup** or within **content scripts** injected into specific web pages.

- **Steps**:

  1. **Create a Svelte project**:
     - Initialize a basic Svelte project:
       ```bash
       npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
       cd svelte-app
       npm install
       ```
  2. **Structure the UI** for the popup (e.g., forms, buttons, progress bars for tasks):

     - Example popup component:

       ```html
       <script>
         let inputFile;
         function handleFileUpload(event) {
           inputFile = event.target.files[0];
         }
       </script>

       <input type="file" on:change="{handleFileUpload}" />
       <button>Start AI Task</button>
       ```

  3. **Build the project for the extension** using the `npm run build` command and package it into your Chrome extension.

##### **WASM Setup**

For WASM, we’ll use **Rust** or **Go**, which compile efficiently to WebAssembly. WASM modules will handle all compute-heavy tasks like **AI data processing**.

- **Steps**:

  1. **Set up the Rust environment** (if using Rust for WASM):

     ```bash
     cargo new --lib wasm-ai
     cd wasm-ai
     cargo install wasm-pack
     ```

  2. **Write the WASM code** for AI processing (e.g., text recognition, classification, or data extraction from documents):

     ```rust
     use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

     #[wasm_bindgen]
     pub fn process_data(data: Vec<u8>) -> String {
         // Perform AI or heavy computation here
         let result = format!("Processed {} bytes of data", data.len());
         result
     }
     ```

  3. **Compile to WASM**:
     ```bash
     wasm-pack build --target web
     ```
     This generates the WASM module, which can be invoked directly from JavaScript in the Svelte app.

##### **Chrome Extension Setup**

The Chrome Extension connects all the components, and the setup requires a few configurations in `manifest.json` to manage background scripts, permissions, and how the extension interacts with browser APIs.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Define the manifest** for your Chrome Extension:
     ```json
     {
       "manifest_version": 3,
       "action": {
         "default_popup": "popup.html"
       },
       "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab"],
       "background": {
         "service_worker": "background.js"
       }
     }
     ```
  2. **Add content scripts** (if necessary) to inject Svelte components into other web pages or collect data from CRMs or forms.

#### **2.2 WASM Integration**

##### **Task Offloading to WASM**

To keep the UI responsive, computationally intensive tasks like **AI processing** or **data analysis** should be offloaded to WASM. This allows Svelte to manage UI rendering and user interactions without being blocked by background tasks.

- **Steps**:

  1. **Call the WASM function** from the Svelte app:

     ```javascript
     import initWasm, { process_data } from "./wasm/wasm_module.js";

     async function handleFileProcessing() {
       await initWasm(); // Load the WASM module
       const data = await inputFile.arrayBuffer(); // Read file as binary
       const result = process_data(new Uint8Array(data)); // Call WASM function
       console.log(result); // Show processed result in UI
     }
     ```

  2. **Manage the asynchronous nature** of the WASM processing by using **promises**:
     - This ensures that the Svelte UI remains responsive while waiting for the WASM task to complete.

##### **Structuring WASM Code for the UI**

Since we will call the WASM functions from JavaScript, it’s a good idea to **abstract the WASM functionality into JS wrappers** to simplify integration:

- **Example wrapper**:
  ```javascript
  export async function processDocument(document) {
    const wasm = await initWasm();
    const processedData = wasm.process_data(new Uint8Array(document));
    return processedData;
  }
  ```

This allows the Svelte app to cleanly interface with the WASM module without needing to worry about the lower-level details.

#### **2.3 Chrome Extension Specifics**

##### **Background Scripts**

The background script in a Chrome extension is used for long-running tasks like **AI model fetching**, **API calls**, or **syncing data** with external servers. These scripts run independently of the popup and can manage complex tasks without blocking the UI.

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    console.log("Background script running");
  });

  chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
    if (request.action === "processData") {
      // Handle long-running tasks here, like AI model processing
      sendResponse({ result: "Data processed successfully" });
    }
  });
  ```

##### **Content Scripts**

Content scripts are injected into third-party web pages to collect data (e.g., client forms, CRM entries) or interact with web apps. This data can then be passed to WASM for AI processing or stored for workflow automation.

- **Example**:  
  Suppose you need to extract data from a web form on a CRM page, you would inject the Svelte UI into the page and then extract the form data for processing:

  ```javascript
  // content.js
  const formData = document.querySelector("form").elements;
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "processData", data: formData });
  ```

---

This setup establishes the foundation for a robust Chrome Extension with a Svelte-based UI that integrates with a powerful WASM engine for AI processing, making it highly efficient for workflow automation.

```bash
nvim svelte_wasm_chrome_setup_workflow.md
```
