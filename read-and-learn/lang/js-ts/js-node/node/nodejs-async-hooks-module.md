### 2. **Async Hooks Module** (`async_hooks`)

The `async_hooks` module allows you to track the lifecycle of asynchronous resources in Node.js. It provides mechanisms to monitor the start and completion of asynchronous operations, which is particularly useful for debugging and performance monitoring.

#### Key Methods and Classes:
1. **AsyncHook**: The core class that creates an instance of an asynchronous hook. It allows you to track asynchronous events by specifying lifecycle callbacks.
   - **new AsyncHook(callbacks)**: Instantiates a new `AsyncHook` instance. The `callbacks` parameter is an object containing the following lifecycle callbacks:
     - **init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource)**: Called when an asynchronous resource is initialized.
     - **before(asyncId)**: Invoked before an asynchronous resource executes.
     - **after(asyncId)**: Invoked after an asynchronous resource has executed.
     - **destroy(asyncId)**: Called when an asynchronous resource is destroyed.
     - **promiseResolve(asyncId)**: Called when a Promise is resolved.
   
2. **async_hooks.executionAsyncId()**: Returns the `asyncId` of the currently executing resource.
   
3. **async_hooks.triggerAsyncId()**: Returns the `asyncId` of the resource that caused the currently executing resource to be created.
   
4. **AsyncHook.enable()**: Activates the hook.
   
5. **AsyncHook.disable()**: Deactivates the hook.

#### Example:
```js
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');
const fs = require('fs');

// Custom callback functions for the async resource lifecycle
const hooks = {
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `Init: asyncId=${asyncId}, type=${type}, triggerAsyncId=${triggerAsyncId}\n`);
  },
  before(asyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `Before: asyncId=${asyncId}\n`);
  },
  after(asyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `After: asyncId=${asyncId}\n`);
  },
  destroy(asyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `Destroy: asyncId=${asyncId}\n`);
  }
};

// Create a new AsyncHook instance
const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook(hooks);
asyncHook.enable();

// Example asynchronous function
setTimeout(() => {
  fs.writeSync(1, 'Timeout callback executed\n');
}, 100);
```

#### Use Cases:
- **Debugging and Profiling**: Track the start, execution, and end of async tasks in Node.js applications.
- **Custom Tracing Tools**: Build your own tracing systems for complex asynchronous applications.
  
The `async_hooks` module is low-level, typically used in development environments or for advanced debugging and instrumentation.
