#### **3.3 More Advanced Software Design Patterns**

##### **6. Strategy Pattern**

- **Overview**: 
  - The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is useful for applications that require varying behaviors based on different conditions.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  class Strategy {
      execute(data) {
          throw new Error('Strategy method not implemented');
      }
  }

  class ConcreteStrategyA extends Strategy {
      execute(data) {
          return `Processing data with Strategy A: ${data}`;
      }
  }

  class ConcreteStrategyB extends Strategy {
      execute(data) {
          return `Processing data with Strategy B: ${data}`;
      }
  }

  class Context {
      constructor(strategy) {
          this.strategy = strategy;
      }

      setStrategy(strategy) {
          this.strategy = strategy;
      }

      process(data) {
          return this.strategy.execute(data);
      }
  }

  const context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyA());
  console.log(context.process('some data')); // Outputs: Processing data with Strategy A: some data

  context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyB());
  console.log(context.process('some data')); // Outputs: Processing data with Strategy B: some data
  ```

##### **7. Middleware Pattern**

- **Overview**: 
  - The Middleware Pattern is commonly used in web frameworks like Express.js to allow multiple functions to handle HTTP requests. Each function can either process the request, end the response, or call the next middleware.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
  };

  const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
      const authenticated = true; // Example authentication check
      if (authenticated) {
          next();
      } else {
          res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
      }
  };

  app.use(loggerMiddleware);
  app.use(authMiddleware);

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello, World!');
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
  });
  ```

##### **8. Decorator Pattern**

- **Overview**: 
  - The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This is useful for adding features to functions or classes in a flexible way.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  class Coffee {
      cost() {
          return 5; // Base cost of coffee
      }
  }

  class MilkDecorator {
      constructor(coffee) {
          this.coffee = coffee;
      }

      cost() {
          return this.coffee.cost() + 1; // Add cost of milk
      }
  }

  class SugarDecorator {
      constructor(coffee) {
          this.coffee = coffee;
      }

      cost() {
          return this.coffee.cost() + 0.5; // Add cost of sugar
      }
  }

  let myCoffee = new Coffee();
  myCoffee = new MilkDecorator(myCoffee);
  myCoffee = new SugarDecorator(myCoffee);
  console.log(`Total Cost: $${myCoffee.cost()}`); // Outputs: Total Cost: $6.5
  ```

---

##### **9. Command Pattern**

- **Overview**: 
  - The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing undo functionalities.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  class Command {
      execute() {
          throw new Error('Command method not implemented');
      }
  }

  class ConcreteCommandA extends Command {
      execute() {
          console.log('Executing Command A');
      }
  }

  class ConcreteCommandB extends Command {
      execute() {
          console.log('Executing Command B');
      }
  }

  class Invoker {
      constructor() {
          this.commands = [];
      }

      storeCommand(command) {
          this.commands.push(command);
      }

      executeCommands() {
          this.commands.forEach(command => command.execute());
      }
  }

  const invoker = new Invoker();
  invoker.storeCommand(new ConcreteCommandA());
  invoker.storeCommand(new ConcreteCommandB());
  invoker.executeCommands();
  // Outputs:
  // Executing Command A
  // Executing Command B
  ```

---

##### **10. Facade Pattern**

- **Overview**: 
  - The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. This pattern is useful for reducing the complexity of interactions between multiple libraries or modules.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  class SubsystemA {
      operationA() {
          return 'Subsystem A: Ready!';
      }
  }

  class SubsystemB {
      operationB() {
          return 'Subsystem B: Ready!';
      }
  }

  class Facade {
      constructor() {
          this.subsystemA = new SubsystemA();
          this.subsystemB = new SubsystemB();
      }

      operation() {
          return `${this.subsystemA.operationA()} ${this.subsystemB.operationB()}`;
      }
  }

  const facade = new Facade();
  console.log(facade.operation()); // Outputs: Subsystem A: Ready! Subsystem B: Ready!
  ```

#### **3.4 Benefits of Using Design Patterns**

- **Reusability**: Design patterns promote code reuse, reducing redundancy and simplifying maintenance.

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: They allow for changes in the system with minimal disruption. New features can be added with less effort.

- **Improved Communication**: Using common patterns provides a shared language among developers, making it easier to discuss design decisions.

- **Ease of Testing**: Many patterns promote separation of concerns, making components easier to test individually.

---

#### **3.5 Real-World Application of Design Patterns**

- **Scalability**: Patterns like the Singleton and Factory can be used to manage configurations or services that should only have one instance, such as database connections.

- **Microservices**: The Facade Pattern can help create a unified API layer for multiple microservices, simplifying interaction.

- **Event-driven Systems**: The Observer Pattern is particularly useful in event-driven architectures, where components need to react to state changes in other parts of the application.

- **Middleware**: In Express.js, middleware patterns allow for flexible handling of HTTP requests, promoting code separation and reusable functionalities.
