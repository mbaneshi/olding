### **Session 5: Real-World Examples and Best Practices in Node.js**

---

#### **5.1 Introduction to Real-World Applications**

- **Importance**: Understanding how design patterns and techniques apply to real-world scenarios helps reinforce concepts and provides insight into effective implementation strategies.

- **Goal**: This session aims to showcase practical applications, highlighting common challenges and best practices in Node.js development.

---

#### **5.2 Real-World Use Cases**

##### **1. Building a RESTful API**

- **Scenario**: Developing a RESTful API for managing users in a web application.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Middleware Pattern**: Used for request logging, authentication, and error handling.
  - **Singleton Pattern**: For managing database connections to ensure a single instance.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');

  // Middleware for logging
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      next();
  });

  // Singleton Database Connection
  let dbInstance;
  const connectToDatabase = async () => {
      if (!dbInstance) {
          dbInstance = await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb');
      }
      return dbInstance;
  };

  app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
      const db = await connectToDatabase();
      const users = await db.collection('users').find().toArray();
      res.json(users);
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
  });
  ```

##### **2. Implementing Real-time Chat with WebSockets**

- **Scenario**: Building a real-time chat application using WebSockets.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Observer Pattern**: For handling events such as user messages and status updates.
  - **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating chat commands (e.g., send message, change status).

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  const http = require('http');
  const WebSocket = require('ws');

  const server = http.createServer();
  const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

  wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
      ws.on('message', (message) => {
          console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
          // Broadcast to all clients
          wss.clients.forEach(client => {
              if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
                  client.send(message);
              }
          });
      });
  });

  server.listen(8080, () => {
      console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
  });
  ```

##### **3. File Upload Service with Streaming**

- **Scenario**: Creating a file upload service that handles large files efficiently.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Stream Pattern**: For handling large file uploads without consuming excessive memory.
  - **Facade Pattern**: For providing a simple interface to the upload process.

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const multer = require('multer');
  const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
  const app = express();

  app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
      res.send(`File uploaded: ${req.file.originalname}`);
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
  });
  ```

---

##### **4. Microservices Architecture for E-commerce**

- **Scenario**: Building an e-commerce platform using a microservices architecture.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Facade Pattern**: To simplify interactions between services.
  - **Strategy Pattern**: For handling different payment gateways.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Order Service**: Manages orders.
  - **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing using the Strategy Pattern to allow different payment methods.
  ```javascript
  // Payment strategies
  class PaymentStrategy {
      pay(amount) {
          throw new Error('Payment method not implemented');
      }
  }

  class PayPalStrategy extends PaymentStrategy {
      pay(amount) {
          console.log(`Paying $${amount} using PayPal.`);
      }
  }

  class CreditCardStrategy extends PaymentStrategy {
      pay(amount) {
          console.log(`Paying $${amount} using Credit Card.`);
      }
  }

  class Order {
      constructor(paymentStrategy) {
          this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
      }

      processOrder(amount) {
          this.paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
      }
  }

  // Usage
  const order1 = new Order(new PayPalStrategy());
  order1.processOrder(100); // Outputs: Paying $100 using PayPal.
  ```

#### **5.3 Best Practices for Code Quality**

- **Consistent Code Style**: Use tools like ESLint or Prettier to maintain a consistent coding style across the project.

- **Modular Structure**: Organize code into modules and directories based on features, keeping the structure clear and maintainable.

- **Documentation**: Use tools like JSDoc to document code and APIs, making it easier for others to understand and use.

- **Testing and CI/CD**: Implement unit and integration tests, and use Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate testing and deployment processes.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog to track application performance and identify bottlenecks.
