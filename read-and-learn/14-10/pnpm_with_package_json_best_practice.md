Yes, you are correct! Using **PNPM** along with a `package.json` is an excellent choice for Node.js projects. It offers several advantages, especially when it comes to efficient package management, dependency sharing, and minimizing disk space usage.

### Why PNPM with `package.json`?

1. **Efficient Space Usage**: PNPM uses a global store for dependencies, so even if multiple projects require the same package, PNPM will store only one copy, reducing disk space usage.

2. **Consistency**: By declaring your dependencies and scripts in `package.json`, you ensure that your project’s environment is reproducible across different machines.

3. **Speed**: PNPM’s content-addressable storage and optimized package resolution process make it faster than NPM and Yarn in many scenarios.

4. **Monorepo Support**: If you have multiple packages, PNPM provides strong support for monorepos through workspaces, sharing dependencies efficiently across projects.

### Key Steps:

1. **Create a `package.json` file**:
   You can initialize a new project with:

   ```bash
   pnpm init
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use PNPM to install packages, which will update your `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

   ```bash
   pnpm install <package-name>
   ```

3. **Run Scripts**:
   Just like with NPM or Yarn, you can define and run scripts from your `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node index.js",
       "build": "tsc"
     }
   }
   ```

   Run them with:

   ```bash
   pnpm run start
   ```

### Best Practice:
- Always commit the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to ensure everyone working on the project gets the same versions of dependencies.
- Leverage **Corepack** to manage PNPM versions consistently across environments.

Using **PNPM** with `package.json` will give you both space efficiency and a solid, predictable dependency management experience!
