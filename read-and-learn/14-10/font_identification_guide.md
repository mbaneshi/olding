To identify fonts used on a website, you can use several Google Chrome extensions that make it easy to find font names and details. Here are some popular options:

1. **WhatFont**: This extension allows you to hover over text on a webpage to reveal the font name, size, line height, and more. It's straightforward and user-friendly.

2. **Fontanello**: Fontanello enables you to select text on a webpage and see the font details in a pop-up. It also provides CSS information for easy integration into your projects.

3. **Fonts Ninja**: Fonts Ninja not only identifies fonts but also allows you to try them out and purchase them. It shows detailed information like font styles, weights, and where to buy.

4. **Page Ruler Redux**: While primarily a ruler tool for measuring elements on the page, it also displays font information in the sidebar when you select text.

5. **Font Finder**: This tool provides extensive details about the fonts used on a webpage, including font-family, size, weight, and color. You can click on text to gather font data.

2. **Activate the Extension**: Click on the extension icon in your browser's toolbar to activate it.
