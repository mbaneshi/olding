The error you're seeing often occurs when there's a network-related issue during the cloning process, such as connection instability, high latency, or issues with large repositories. Here are several steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Increase Git buffer size**:
   The repository you're cloning might be large, and increasing Git's buffer size may help.
   ```bash
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
   ```

2. **Clone with a depth parameter**:
   If you don't need the full history, you can clone the repository with limited commit history, which reduces the data transferred.
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git
   ```

3. **Use SSH instead of HTTPS**:
   If you're using HTTPS to clone, try using SSH instead.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:n8n-io/n8n.git
   ```

4. **Check your internet connection**:
   Ensure your connection is stable, and if you're behind a proxy (like your SOCKS5 proxy), ensure it's not causing any issues.

5. **Retry the clone**:
   Sometimes, the issue is temporary, and retrying the clone might work after some time.

6. **Use Git LFS for large files**:
   If the repository has large files, using [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) might help:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git
   ```

Try any of these steps and see if it resolves the issue.
