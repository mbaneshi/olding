You're absolutely right! Installing **PNPM** globally using `npm install -g pnpm` can cause conflicts with **Corepack**, which is now the recommended way to manage package managers like PNPM, Yarn, and others, especially in Node.js 16.9.0+.

### The Best Practice: Using **Corepack**

Since Node.js 16.9.0+, **Corepack** is included by default and provides a way to manage different package managers without installing them globally. This avoids version conflicts and improves reproducibility.

### Steps to Use PNPM with Corepack:

1. **Enable Corepack**:
   If you're using Node.js 16.9.0 or newer, you should already have **Corepack** available. If not, enable it by running:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

2. **Install PNPM with Corepack**:
   Instead of using `npm install -g pnpm`, you can install PNPM via **Corepack**. This ensures that you use the version recommended by your project or lockfile.

   To install and enable the latest version of PNPM:

   ```bash
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   ```

   This will activate **PNPM** globally without polluting the global `npm` installation, avoiding conflicts.

3. **Specifying PNPM Version in Project**:
   If you want to pin a specific version of PNPM for your project, you can add the `engines` field in your `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "engines": {
       "pnpm": ">=7.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   This ensures consistency across different environments and prevents mismatches.

4. **Manage PNPM Versions**:
   With Corepack, you can manage multiple versions of **PNPM** easily. For example, if you need a specific version, you can prepare it as follows:

   ```bash
   corepack prepare pnpm@6.14.8 --activate
   ```

   This allows you to switch between versions seamlessly without installing or uninstalling globally.

5. **Check PNPM Version**:
   To verify which version of PNPM you're using, run:

   ```bash
   pnpm --version
   ```

6. **PNPM Usage**:
   You can now use **PNPM** just like before, but without the risk of conflicts between Corepack and globally installed versions.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

By using **Corepack**, you avoid conflicts and can manage package manager versions in a cleaner, more reproducible way.

### Why Avoid `npm install -g pnpm`:
- **Version Conflicts**: Manually installing a global version can conflict with versions managed by Corepack.
- **Global Pollution**: Installing globally with `npm` affects your entire environment, whereas **Corepack** keeps version control tight and local to the project or environment.

### Key Takeaways:
- Use **Corepack** to manage package managers like **PNPM**.
- Avoid global installations to prevent version mismatches and conflicts.
