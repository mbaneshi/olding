I want to learn ios platform and swift programming with a focus on design principles and component architecture. I need a comprehensive guide that will not only explain the fundamentals of ios UI/UX but also provide a deep dive into every key component of the apple platform. This should include layouts, views, activities, fragments, the ios lifecycle, resource management, and more. Ultimately, I want a high-level outline of a book that covers all aspects of swift programming in great detailâ€”perfect for someone who wants to understand the platform in its entirety.
