### Part 2: **Search Algorithms**

Search algorithms are fundamental techniques used to retrieve specific elements from data structures like arrays, trees, or graphs. The efficiency of a search algorithm depends on the data structure used and the properties of the dataset.

#### **1. Linear Search**

- **Description**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Best Case**: O(1) (when the element is at the beginning)
- **Worst Case**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use Case**: Suitable for unsorted arrays or small datasets.

#### **2. Binary Search**

- **Description**: A fast search algorithm for sorted arrays that repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Best Case**: O(1) (when the middle element is the target)
- **Worst Case**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (iterative) or O(log n) (recursive)
- **Use Case**: Efficient for sorted arrays and data structures like binary search trees.

#### **3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

- **Description**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the next level in a graph or tree.
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Use Case**: Used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs or for traversing trees level by level.

#### **4. Depth-First Search (DFS)**

- **Description**: Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking, used in graphs or trees.
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Use Case**: Suitable for tasks like topological sorting, finding connected components, or detecting cycles in graphs.

#### **5. Jump Search**

- **Description**: A search algorithm for sorted arrays that skips ahead by fixed steps and then performs linear search when it finds a range containing the target.
- **Time Complexity**: O(√n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use Case**: Faster than linear search but less efficient than binary search, used when random access is costly.

#### **6. Exponential Search**

- **Description**: A search algorithm that doubles the range of search intervals (exponentially) and then uses binary search in the relevant range.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use Case**: Best suited for searching in unbounded or infinite lists, or for lists where the size is unknown.

### Specialized Search Algorithms:

#### **7. Interpolation Search**

- **Description**: An improved version of binary search that estimates the position of the target by assuming the data is uniformly distributed.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log log n) (best case), O(n) (worst case)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use Case**: Effective for searching in uniformly distributed datasets (e.g., indexed files or databases).

#### **8. Ternary Search**

- **Description**: Similar to binary search, but it divides the search space into three parts instead of two.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log3 n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use Case**: Works well when the search space can be divided into three equal parts, typically used in optimization problems.

#### **9. Fibonacci Search**

- **Description**: A search algorithm based on dividing the search range using Fibonacci numbers. It is suitable for sorted arrays.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Use Case**: An alternative to binary search with some performance benefits in cases with slow read times (e.g., disk-based searching).

#### **10. A\* Search Algorithm**

- **Description**: A pathfinding algorithm used in graph-based searching. It combines the benefits of both BFS and DFS and uses a heuristic to guide its search.
- **Time Complexity**: O(E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(E)
- **Use Case**: Widely used in games and AI for finding the shortest path.

#### **11. Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

- **Description**: A search algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, where each edge has a non-negative weight.
- **Time Complexity**: O(E + V log V)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Use Case**: Used for route planning, network routing, and GPS navigation.

#### **12. Bidirectional Search**

- **Description**: A search that runs two simultaneous searches, one forward from the start and one backward from the target, stopping when they meet.
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^(d/2)) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the solution.
- **Space Complexity**: O(b^(d/2))
- **Use Case**: Efficient for problems where the initial and goal states are known, such as solving puzzles or pathfinding in grids.

#### **13. Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**

- **Description**: Combines the depth-limited nature of DFS with the completeness of BFS, by gradually increasing the depth limit.
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the shallowest solution.
- **Space Complexity**: O(bd)
- **Use Case**: Ideal for large search trees where the depth is not known in advance, used in AI and problem-solving.

**Conclusion**: Search algorithms are essential for locating data in collections like arrays, trees, and graphs. Basic algorithms like **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** are fundamental, while more complex algorithms like **A\* Search** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** are useful for real-world applications involving graphs and pathfinding. Choosing the right search algorithm depends on factors like dataset size, structure, and the specific use case.
