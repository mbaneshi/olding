### **Part 4: Graph-Based Data Structures**

Graph-based data structures model relationships between entities, making them essential for solving problems in networking, social media, search engines, and various algorithms. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Here’s a detailed overview of graph-based data structures:

---

#### **1. Graph**

- **Definition**: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are highly versatile structures used to represent relationships between objects.
- **Types of Graphs**:

  - **Undirected Graph**: The edges have no direction, meaning if an edge exists between vertex `u` and vertex `v`, it can be traversed in both directions.
  - **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a direction. If an edge exists from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, it can only be traversed from `u` to `v`.
  - **Weighted Graph**: Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. This is commonly used to model problems where distances or costs need to be optimized (e.g., road networks).
  - **Unweighted Graph**: The edges do not have any associated weights.
  - **Cyclic Graph**: Contains at least one cycle, meaning there is a path from at least one vertex back to itself.
  - **Acyclic Graph**: Contains no cycles.
  - **Connected Graph**: There is a path between every pair of vertices.
  - **Disconnected Graph**: Some vertices are not reachable from others.

- **Representation of Graphs**:
  - **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where `A[i][j]` is non-zero if there is an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`. This representation requires O(V²) space, where V is the number of vertices, but it allows quick lookup of edges.
  - **Adjacency List**: An array of lists. Each index in the array corresponds to a vertex, and each list at that index contains the vertices that are adjacent to it. It is more space-efficient, requiring O(V + E) space, where E is the number of edges.
- **Graph Traversal**:

  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors of a vertex before moving to their neighbors. BFS is used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. DFS is used for tasks such as finding connected components and topological sorting.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Social Networks**: Model relationships between people.
  - **Web Crawlers**: Represent the web as a graph of interconnected pages.
  - **Pathfinding**: Solve shortest path problems in maps (e.g., GPS navigation).

#### **2. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**

- **Definition**: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a directed graph that has no cycles, meaning there is no way to start at one vertex and return to it by following the directed edges.
- **Properties**:

  - **Topological Ordering**: In a DAG, the vertices can be ordered linearly such that for every directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.
  - **Acyclic**: Since there are no cycles, DAGs are often used to represent dependencies.

- **Time Complexity**:

  - **Topological Sort**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Task Scheduling**: Represent tasks that have dependencies (e.g., building a software project with modules).
  - **Data Flow**: In compiler optimizations, DAGs are used to represent expression evaluation.
  - **Version Control**: Git uses DAGs to model the relationships between commits.

#### **3. Weighted Graph**

- **Definition**: A graph in which each edge has a weight (or cost) associated with it. Weighted graphs are used when the relationships between nodes have values, such as distance or time.

- **Graph Algorithms**:

  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Used to find the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works only for graphs with non-negative weights.
    - **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) with a priority queue.
  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Solves the shortest path problem even if the graph contains negative weight edges, but it does not work with negative weight cycles.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(V \* E).
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(V³).

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Routing Algorithms**: Weighted graphs are used in networking to find the shortest path between routers.
  - **Maps and Navigation**: Representing road networks where each edge’s weight corresponds to distance or travel time.

#### **4. Bipartite Graph**

- **Definition**: A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. This type of graph is used in matching problems.
- **Properties**:
  - **Coloring**: Bipartite graphs can be colored using two colors. If the graph can be colored in two colors, it is bipartite.
  - **Matching**: In a bipartite graph, matching refers to pairing vertices from one set with vertices from the other set such that no two pairs share a vertex.
- **Graph Algorithms**:

  - **Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm**: Used to find the maximum matching in a bipartite graph.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(√V \* E).

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Job Assignments**: Match workers to jobs where each worker has qualifications for certain jobs.
  - **Recommender Systems**: Representing users and items, where edges represent a user’s interest in an item.

#### **5. Complete Graph**

- **Definition**: A complete graph is a graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. In a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices, there are `n(n-1)/2` edges.
- **Properties**:

  - A complete graph is highly connected, with the maximum number of edges possible.
  - It has significant use in theoretical graph studies and in problems requiring a fully connected network (e.g., in telecommunication).

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Networking**: Full connectivity is required in some systems like mesh networks.
  - **Combinatorial Problems**: Complete graphs are used in combinatorics to analyze complex relationships.

#### **6. Planar Graph**

- **Definition**: A graph is called planar if it can be drawn on a plane without any of its edges crossing. Planar graphs have applications in geographical mapping and circuit design.

- **Properties**:
  - **Kuratowski’s Theorem**: A graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K₅ (complete graph on five vertices) or K₃,₃ (complete bipartite graph on six vertices).
- **Time Complexity**:

  - Planarity testing algorithms (like Hopcroft and Tarjan’s algorithm) run in linear time: O(V).

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Geographical Mapping**: Planar graphs are used to represent maps where vertices are locations and edges are roads or connections between them.
  - **Circuit Design**: Planar graphs are used in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design to avoid crossing connections.

#### **7. Sparse and Dense Graphs**

- **Sparse Graph**: A graph with relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices. For a graph with `n` vertices, if the number of edges is closer to O(n), it is considered sparse.
- **Dense Graph**: A graph with a number of edges close to the maximum number of edges, which is O(n²) for `n` vertices.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Sparse Graphs**: Common in social networks and geographical networks, where only a few connections exist between nodes.
  - **Dense Graphs**: Used in complete networks, where most nodes are interconnected, such as in highly connected transportation networks.

### **Graph Algorithms**

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used to explore the graph level by level. BFS is particularly useful in unweighted graphs to find the shortest path from one node to another. Time complexity: O(V + E).

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores the graph by diving deep into one branch before backtracking. DFS is useful for detecting cycles, topological sorting, and connectivity checks. Time complexity: O(V + E).

- **Kruskal’s and Prim’s Algorithms** (Minimum Spanning Tree):

  - **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) using a greedy approach by sorting edges by weight and then adding them to the MST if they do not form a cycle.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(E log E) due to edge sorting.
  - **Prim’s Algorithm**: Builds the MST by starting from an arbitrary vertex and growing the tree one edge at a time by adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(V²) or O(E log V) with a priority queue.

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**:

  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from one source vertex to all other vertices. It works with non-negative edge weights.
  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Used for finding shortest paths in graphs with negative weights.

- **Network Flow Algorithms**:
  - **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**: Computes the maximum flow in a flow network. Time complexity depends on the number of augmenting paths found.
  - **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**: An implementation of Ford-Fulkerson using BFS. Time complexity: O(V \* E²).
