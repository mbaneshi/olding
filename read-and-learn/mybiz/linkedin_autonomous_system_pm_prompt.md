## **Prompt for Project Management & Development of Autonomous AI-Powered System**

### **Objective:**
We are building an **autonomous AI-powered system** to manage customer service, process inquiries, automate LinkedIn tasks, and post content. Initially, this system will serve our own business needs but will be developed with **scalability** and **customizability** in mind for eventual use by other **small businesses**.

### **Tech Stack Overview:**
1. **Streamlit, FastAPI, PostgreSQL**:  
   Used for the **admin dashboard** to manage and configure the system, track data, and monitor performance.
   
2. **Google Chrome Extension**:  
   **Attached to our LinkedIn business page** to trigger tasks, run scripts, and connect with LinkedIn API for task automation.

3. **Node.js (Express) & Playwright**:  
   Handles **end-to-end automation** tasks, content posting, and document processing, integrated with LinkedIn API for seamless automation.

4. **LinkedIn API**:  
   Central to automating LinkedIn tasks like content posting, lead generation, customer service, and engagement tracking.

5. **AI-Powered Automation**:  
   AI modules will be developed to autonomously handle inquiries, generate responses, and process business tasks based on predefined logic.

### **Project Management & Planning Guide:**

1. **Initial Software Development Plan:**
   - **Objective:** Establish an AI-powered autonomous system for internal use, with the ability to handle LinkedIn tasks, customer inquiries, and automate processes.
   - **Architecture Design**: Focus on **modular architecture** to ensure future customization and scalability.
   - **Database**: Implement **PostgreSQL** with a well-structured schema to manage user data, LinkedIn interactions, and system logs.
   - **API Integration**: Use **FastAPI** to create endpoints that interface with the LinkedIn API and handle asynchronous tasks triggered by customer inquiries or scheduled actions.
   - **Admin Dashboard**: Create an intuitive interface using **Streamlit** for monitoring, configuration, and managing AI-driven processes.

2. **Google Chrome Extension**:
   - Build a **Chrome extension** that integrates with LinkedIn, allowing users to manually trigger tasks or run automation scripts. This will be pivotal for monitoring the LinkedIn business page, initiating API interactions, and running Playwright-based scripts.

3. **LinkedIn API Automation**:
   - Define **core tasks** for LinkedIn automation, such as:
     - Scheduling and automating posts.
     - Capturing and processing **inquiries** via LinkedIn forms.
     - Monitoring **engagement metrics** to refine AI responses.
   - Automate lead generation and follow-ups using **Node.js** and **Playwright** for content posting, customer engagement, and analytics.

4. **AI-Powered Inquiry Management**:
   - Use **AI models** to process inquiries, auto-generate responses, and categorize leads based on interest or business fit.
   - Integrate the AI with the **FastAPI backend**, allowing inquiries from LinkedIn or external forms to trigger automated workflows.
   - Implement **natural language processing (NLP)** models to understand customer inquiries and provide intelligent responses.

5. **Scalability & Customization for Future Use**:
   - **Scalability**: From day one, develop with scaling in mind—ensure your system can handle **multiple tenants** (small businesses) by implementing multi-tenancy at the database level (PostgreSQL) and by creating API endpoints that can handle different customer configurations.
   - **Customization**: Develop configuration options within the admin dashboard so small businesses can tailor the system to their specific needs (custom posting schedules, inquiry workflows, content formats, etc.).
   - **Best Practices**: Adhere to **clean code**, **test-driven development (TDD)**, and maintain documentation for all code modules and API interactions.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Set up real-time **monitoring and logging** to ensure the system remains responsive as it scales.

6. **Project Milestones**:
   - **Phase 1: Core System Development (1-2 months)**
     - Set up the admin dashboard, Google Chrome extension, and API integration.
     - Build core AI modules for inquiry processing and LinkedIn automation.
   - **Phase 2: Testing & Iteration (1 month)**
     - Conduct internal testing, fine-tune the system based on user feedback, and ensure seamless integration with LinkedIn API.
     - Implement load testing to ensure scalability.
   - **Phase 3: Expansion & Customization (2-3 months)**
     - Begin work on customization options and multi-tenancy for small business clients.
     - Develop documentation and tutorials for external users.

7. **Maintenance & Continuous Improvement**:
   - Implement **CI/CD pipelines** to automatically test, deploy, and monitor the system for issues.
   - Build a **feedback loop** that allows real-time user input to shape the evolution of the system, ensuring responsiveness to changing market needs.
   - Maintain **data security** and **GDPR compliance** by ensuring user data is encrypted and managed securely.

8. **Marketing & Offering the Product to Small Businesses**:
   - Develop a marketing strategy alongside system development to showcase the value of the platform to small businesses.
   - Emphasize the **autonomous capabilities** and ease of configuration, focusing on how businesses can customize it for their specific LinkedIn workflows.
   - Offer **demos**, **free trials**, and **webinars** as part of your outreach to demonstrate how the system can automate business tasks, streamline customer service, and improve engagement on LinkedIn.

This structured plan ensures the project is **scalable**, **maintainable**, and flexible enough to serve both your business and small business clients in the future. By focusing on the tech stack, leveraging the LinkedIn API, and implementing AI, you can deliver a robust autonomous system that scales over time.
