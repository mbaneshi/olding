Exploring open-source tools that align with your tech stack (Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB) is a great way to enhance your development experience (DevX) and automate data extraction from your C++ codebase. Below are several categories of tools, along with specific recommendations that can help streamline your workflow and improve the overall quality of your projects.

### 1. **Static Analysis Tools for C++**

These tools can help you analyze your C++ codebase for potential issues, metrics, and documentation generation:

- **Clang Static Analyzer**
  - **Description**: A powerful tool that analyzes C/C++ source code for bugs and performance issues. You can integrate it with your build system or run it directly on the code.
  - **Link**: [Clang Static Analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/)
  
- **Cppcheck**
  - **Description**: A static analysis tool that detects bugs and undefined behavior in C/C++ code. It can also generate complexity metrics and other useful data.
  - **Link**: [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)

- **Doxygen**
  - **Description**: A documentation generator for C++ and other languages that can create documentation from annotated source code, including call graphs and class diagrams.
  - **Link**: [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/)

### 2. **Visualization Tools**

For visualizing relationships, call graphs, and dependencies in your C++ codebase:

- **Graphviz**
  - **Description**: A graph visualization software that can help create diagrams from structured data. It's useful for visualizing call graphs or class hierarchies.
  - **Link**: [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/)

- **D3.js**
  - **Description**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. Great for integrating with your React frontend.
  - **Link**: [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

### 3. **Code Quality and Metrics Tools**

To assess and improve the quality of your codebase:

- **SonarQube**
  - **Description**: An open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It can provide insights into bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
  - **Link**: [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)

- **ESLint** (for JavaScript/Node.js)
  - **Description**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. Useful for maintaining code quality in your Node.js and React applications.
  - **Link**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

### 4. **Data Extraction and Management Tools**

To facilitate data extraction and storage in your MongoDB:

- **Mongoose**
  - **Description**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to model and interact with your data.
  - **Link**: [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

- **MongoDB Compass**
  - **Description**: A graphical user interface (GUI) for MongoDB that allows you to visualize and manipulate your data. It's particularly useful for managing your data during development.
  - **Link**: [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

### 5. **Integration and Automation Tools**

These tools can help you streamline the integration and automation processes:

- **Jenkins**
  - **Description**: An open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating software projects. You can set it up to run your static analysis tools on every commit.
  - **Link**: [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)

- **GitHub Actions**
  - **Description**: A powerful automation tool that can help you automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository, including running tests and static analysis on your codebase.
  - **Link**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

### 6. **Documentation and Collaboration Tools**

Enhancing collaboration and documentation can improve DevX:

- **Markdown**
  - **Description**: Use Markdown for creating documentation that is easy to read and write. It can be integrated into your Git workflow (e.g., README files).
  
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**
  - **Description**: Tools for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. Swagger UI can generate interactive API documentation directly from your Node.js Express app.
  - **Link**: [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

### 7. **Testing Frameworks**

Incorporating testing into your workflow will enhance reliability:

- **Mocha/Chai**
  - **Description**: A testing framework for Node.js and JavaScript that provides a rich set of features for testing applications.
  - **Link**: [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) | [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

- **Jest**
  - **Description**: A delightful JavaScript testing framework that works well with React applications and can also be used with Node.js.
  - **Link**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Integrating Tools with Your Workflow

1. **Setup a CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate running your static analysis tools (like Cppcheck and Clang) on each commit or pull request.

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Use your Node.js script to extract data from your C++ codebase with the help of Doxygen and Cppcheck.
   - Store the extracted data in MongoDB for easy retrieval.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Implement a React frontend that visualizes the extracted data using D3.js or similar libraries.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Use Doxygen to generate documentation from your C++ code and integrate Swagger for your API documentation in Node.js.

5. **Collaboration**:
   - Maintain your project documentation in Markdown files in your Git repository. Use tools like GitHub to manage discussions, issues, and pull requests.

### Conclusion

By selecting and integrating these open-source tools into your existing stack, you can significantly enhance your development experience, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure high code quality. Each tool offers unique features that can address specific needs within your development workflow, from static analysis and documentation generation to visualization and CI/CD.
