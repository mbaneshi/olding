To perform code metrics analysis, you can follow a structured approach that involves selecting appropriate tools, collecting metrics, and storing the data in a suitable format for analysis and visualization. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how you can accomplish this:

### 1. Select Tools for Metrics Collection

- **SonarQube**: A popular tool that provides various code quality metrics, including cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, lines of code, number of functions, and more. It also offers integrations with CI/CD pipelines.
  
- **CLOC (Count Lines of Code)**: A simple tool to count lines of code in many programming languages, which can provide insights into code size and structure.
  
- **Code Climate**: An analysis tool that provides a wide range of metrics, including maintainability and test coverage.

- **ESLint**: For JavaScript projects, ESLint can be configured to calculate metrics related to code quality.

### 2. Define Metrics to Collect

You can collect various metrics based on your requirements. Here are some key metrics to consider:

- **Lines of Code (LOC)**: Total lines of code in the codebase.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: A measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code.
- **Number of Functions/Methods**: Total number of functions or methods in the codebase.
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests.
- **Code Duplication**: Percentage of duplicate code in the codebase.
- **Technical Debt**: A measure of how much "quick-and-dirty" work is present in the codebase.

### 3. Collecting Metrics

**Using SonarQube**:
1. **Installation**: Set up SonarQube on your machine or server.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the analysis parameters in the `sonar-project.properties` file.
3. **Run Analysis**: Execute the SonarQube scanner against your project. This will generate a report with the collected metrics.

**Using CLOC**:
1. **Installation**: Install CLOC via package managers or download from the [official website](https://cloc.sourceforge.net/).
2. **Execution**: Run CLOC on your project directory:
   ```bash
   cloc /path/to/your/code
   ```

### 4. Storing Metrics

Choose a data structure for storing the collected metrics. Options include:

- **Relational Database**: 
  - **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Create tables to store metrics with fields for different metrics (e.g., project name, LOC, cyclomatic complexity).
  - **Schema Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE code_metrics (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        project_name VARCHAR(255),
        loc INT,
        cyclomatic_complexity INT,
        num_functions INT,
        code_coverage DECIMAL(5, 2),
        code_duplication DECIMAL(5, 2),
        technical_debt DECIMAL(10, 2),
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

- **JSON Format**: 
  - Create a JSON structure to store metrics:
    ```json
    {
      "project": "example-project",
      "metrics": {
        "loc": 1500,
        "cyclomatic_complexity": 30,
        "num_functions": 50,
        "code_coverage": 75.5,
        "code_duplication": 10.2,
        "technical_debt": 500.0
      }
    }
    ```

### 5. Analyzing and Visualizing Metrics

Once metrics are collected and stored, use visualization tools to analyze them:

- **Grafana**: Can be used to visualize metrics stored in databases like MySQL.
- **Tableau**: A powerful tool for visualizing complex datasets.
- **Python Libraries**: Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for custom visualizations.

### 6. Automation

Consider automating the metrics collection and storage process:

- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate tools like SonarQube into your CI/CD pipeline to run metrics analysis automatically with every build.
- **Scheduled Scripts**: Set up cron jobs or scripts to run metrics collection periodically.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively collect, store, and analyze code metrics to gain insights into the complexity and quality of your codebase. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area, such as tool setup, scripting for automation, or visualization options?
