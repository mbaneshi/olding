Here are some modern alternatives to `sed` and `awk` that offer enhanced functionality, better performance, or a more user-friendly experience:

### Alternatives to `sed` (Stream Editor)

1. **`sd` (Simple Substitute)**:
   - **Description**: A fast and user-friendly alternative to `sed`, `sd` simplifies common text substitution tasks with an easier syntax. It supports regular expressions and is optimized for speed.
   - **Key Feature**: Easier syntax compared to `sed`, designed for simpler text replacement tasks.
   - **Installation**: Available via Rust’s package manager (`cargo install sd`).

2. **`gsed` (GNU sed)**:
   - **Description**: An enhanced version of `sed`, available on most platforms, including Linux and macOS via `Homebrew`. It's fully compatible with traditional `sed` but includes more powerful features like extended regular expressions and improved performance.
   - **Key Feature**: Backwards-compatible with `sed` but with additional options and faster performance.
   - **Installation**: Available via `sudo apt install gsed`.

3. **`sponge` (from `moreutils`)**:
   - **Description**: While not a direct replacement for `sed`, `sponge` is often used in combination with `sed` to make in-place editing simpler and safer (avoiding overwriting files prematurely).
   - **Key Feature**: Allows safe in-place editing by reading from `stdin` and writing output to the same file.
   - **Installation**: Available via `sudo apt install moreutils`.

### Alternatives to `awk` (Pattern Scanning & Processing)

1. **`jq` (JSON Processor)**:
   - **Description**: Not a direct replacement for `awk`, but `jq` is a powerful tool for manipulating structured data in JSON format. It’s widely used for processing API responses or any JSON-based data.
   - **Key Feature**: Designed specifically for JSON, offering powerful filtering, transformation, and data extraction.
   - **Installation**: Available via `sudo apt install jq`.

2. **`mlr` (Miller)**:
   - **Description**: A modern alternative to `awk` that works with both structured (CSV, TSV) and unstructured data. It offers easy-to-use syntax and more built-in functions than traditional `awk`.
   - **Key Feature**: Combines the functionality of `awk`, `sed`, and `cut`, optimized for working with CSV, TSV, and JSON data.
   - **Installation**: Available via `sudo apt install miller`.

3. **`gawk` (GNU awk)**:
   - **Description**: An extended version of `awk` with additional features, including networking support, better debugging, and built-in functions for handling dates and arrays.
   - **Key Feature**: Fully backward-compatible with `awk` but with added modern capabilities, such as JSON support and advanced regex handling.
   - **Installation**: Available via `sudo apt install gawk`.

4. **`goawk`**:
   - **Description**: A modern re-implementation of `awk` written in Go. It offers better performance and additional features, including built-in CSV and JSON support.
   - **Key Feature**: Designed for performance and ease of use, with a clean implementation of `awk` features.
   - **Installation**: Available via `go install github.com/benhoyt/goawk@latest`.
