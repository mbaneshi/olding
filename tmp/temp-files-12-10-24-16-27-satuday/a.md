The output from your `lsof -i :9222` command indicates that there are no processes listening on port `9222`. However, it seems that you have a `Google` process (likely Google Chrome) listening on a different port, possibly associated with some internal or specific Chrome feature (in this case, `localhost:teamcoherence`).

### Next Steps to Troubleshoot Remote Debugging

Since the expected output for port `9222` is not present, here are the steps to ensure that Chrome is properly set up for remote debugging:

1. **Close All Chrome Instances:**
   First, make sure to close any running instances of Google Chrome. You can do this using the following command:
   ```bash
   killall "Google Chrome"
   ```

2. **Start Chrome with the Correct Flag:**
   Open Chrome with the remote debugging port specified. Use the following command in the Terminal:

   ```bash
   open -a "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```

3. **Verify the Process:**
   After running the command, check again to see if Chrome is now listening on port `9222` by running:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :9222
   ```

4. **Check for Output:**
   You should expect to see an output similar to:
   ```
   COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
   Google   12345 username   20u  IPv4 0x123456789abcdef0      0t0  TCP *:9222 (LISTEN)
   ```

5. **Access Remote Debugging:**
   If you see that Chrome is listening on port `9222`, you can now access the remote debugging interface by going to:
   ```
   http://192.168.184.219:9222/json
   ```

### If You Still Don’t See Chrome Listening on Port 9222

- **Try a Different Port:**
  If port `9222` still doesn’t work, you can try another port (e.g., `9223`):
  ```bash
  open -a "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9223
  ```
  Then check with:
  ```bash
  lsof -i :9223
  ```

- **Firewall/Security Software:**
  Ensure that any firewall or security software on your Mac isn’t blocking connections on these ports.

- **Check Chrome Settings:**
  Ensure that no Chrome settings or extensions are interfering with the startup command. You may want to disable any unnecessary extensions or reset Chrome settings.

### Summary

After following these steps, if you can’t get Chrome to listen on port `9222`, let me know what specific behaviors or messages you’re encountering, and I can assist you further!
