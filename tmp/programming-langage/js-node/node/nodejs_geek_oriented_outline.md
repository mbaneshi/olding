To create a **geek-oriented, computer science-heavy approach** to the Node.js book, we need to delve deeply into the **underlying systems**, providing not just practical usage but also covering the **low-level mechanisms** behind Node.js. I'll enhance the previously suggested outline, integrating **theoretical computer science topics** like operating system concepts, compiler design, memory management, and in-depth performance optimization techniques.
