### 20. **Readline Module** (`readline`)

The `readline` module in Node.js provides an interface for reading input from a readable stream (such as `process.stdin`). This module is particularly useful for creating command-line applications that require user input. It facilitates line-by-line input and offers a way to handle user interactions smoothly.

#### Key Concepts in Computer Science:

1. **Input/Output Streams**:
   - Understanding how data flows into and out of an application is crucial for building interactive programs. Readable streams represent sources of data, while writable streams represent destinations for data.

2. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Node.js is built on an asynchronous, non-blocking architecture. The `readline` module uses callbacks and promises, making it important to understand these concepts for handling user input effectively.

3. **Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)**:
   - Many applications interact with users via the command line. Designing a user-friendly CLI involves effectively managing input and providing feedback.

### **Key Methods and Properties in the Readline Module**

1. **`readline.createInterface(options)`**:
   - Creates a new `readline.Interface` instance for reading data from a readable stream (e.g., `process.stdin`).

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   const readline = require('readline');
   const rl = readline.createInterface({
     input: process.stdin,
     output: process.stdout
   });
   ```

2. **`rl.question(query, callback)`**:
   - Displays a prompt to the user and waits for input. The `callback` function is called with the user's input once it is received.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   rl.question('What is your name? ', (name) => {
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
     rl.close(); // Close the interface after getting input
   });
   ```

3. **`rl.on(event, listener)`**:
   - Listens for events on the `readline.Interface`. Common events include `line` (when a new line is input) and `close` (when the input stream is closed).

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   rl.on('line', (input) => {
     console.log(`Received: ${input}`);
   });
   ```

4. **`rl.close()`**:
   - Closes the `readline.Interface`, freeing up resources and closing the input stream.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   rl.close(); // Close the readline interface
   ```

### **Advanced Topics in Input Handling**

1. **Handling Multiple Inputs**:
   - You can set up the interface to read multiple lines by using event listeners. This is useful for collecting extensive user input.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Always validate user input to ensure it meets expected formats or criteria, improving application robustness and user experience.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling for unexpected input or issues with the stream, such as handling the `error` event on the `readline.Interface`.

### **Use Cases**
- **Interactive Command-Line Applications**: Building tools that require user interaction, such as games, quizzes, or configuration scripts.
- **Data Collection**: Gathering user input for processing or logging.
- **Scripts and Automation**: Creating scripts that require dynamic user input for execution.
