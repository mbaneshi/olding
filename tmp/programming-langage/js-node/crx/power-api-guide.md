### 21. **Power API** - In-Depth Guide

The **Power API** allows Chrome extensions to manage the power state of the system, specifically to prevent the computer from sleeping or turning off the display. This is useful in scenarios where a long-running process, such as a video playback or a file download, needs to continue uninterrupted.

---

### **Core Features**

- **Prevent System Sleep**: Stop the system from entering sleep mode.
- **Prevent Display Sleep**: Prevent the screen from turning off or dimming while the extension is running.
- **Temporary Power Overrides**: Dynamically control when the system or display should remain active, based on the needs of the extension.

### **How to Use the Power API**

To use the Power API, declare the `"power"` permission in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "My Power Management Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "permissions": ["power"]
}
```

The API provides two main functions: `requestKeepAwake()` and `releaseKeepAwake()`.

#### **Basic Methods**

1. **Prevent System from Sleeping**

Use `chrome.power.requestKeepAwake()` to stop the system from entering sleep mode. You can specify the level of wake lock: either `"system"` to prevent sleep or `"display"` to prevent the display from turning off.

##### **Example Use Case**: Prevent system sleep during a long-running process

```javascript
chrome.power.requestKeepAwake("system");
```

This will keep the system from going into sleep mode, allowing long-running operations to continue without interruption.

---

2. **Prevent Display from Sleeping**

If you want to prevent the display from turning off while still allowing the rest of the system to enter sleep mode, use the `"display"` option.

##### **Example Use Case**: Keep display active while playing a video

```javascript
chrome.power.requestKeepAwake("display");
```

This will ensure that the screen stays on, which is useful for apps that display critical visual information, such as a video player.

---

3. **Release Power Lock**

Once the long-running process is complete or the extension no longer needs to keep the system or display awake, release the wake lock using `chrome.power.releaseKeepAwake()`.

##### **Example Use Case**: Release power lock when the task is done

```javascript
chrome.power.releaseKeepAwake();
```

This will allow the system and display to revert to their normal power-saving behaviors.

---

### **Use Cases**

#### 1. **Video Playback Extensions**

- **Problem**: Users want to watch videos without the screen turning off or the system entering sleep mode.
- **Solution**: Use the Power API to keep the display on while the video is playing, then release the lock when playback is paused or stopped.

```javascript
function onVideoPlay() {
  chrome.power.requestKeepAwake("display");
}

function onVideoPause() {
  chrome.power.releaseKeepAwake();
}
```

#### 2. **File Download Extensions**

- **Problem**: Long file downloads may be interrupted if the system enters sleep mode.
- **Solution**: Prevent the system from sleeping while large files are downloading, and release the lock once the download completes.

```javascript
function onDownloadStart() {
  chrome.power.requestKeepAwake("system");
}

function onDownloadComplete() {
  chrome.power.releaseKeepAwake();
}
```

#### 3. **Real-time Monitoring Extensions**

- **Problem**: Extensions that monitor real-time data, such as stock prices or sensor readings, need to ensure that the display stays on.
- **Solution**: Use the Power API to prevent the display from turning off during real-time monitoring.

```javascript
function startMonitoring() {
  chrome.power.requestKeepAwake("display");
}

function stopMonitoring() {
  chrome.power.releaseKeepAwake();
}
```

### **Best Practices for Power API**

1. **Use Wake Locks Sparingly**: Only request wake locks when necessary and release them as soon as they are no longer needed. Holding a wake lock for too long drains the battery and affects system performance.

2. **Choose the Right Level of Wake Lock**: If your extension only needs to keep the display on (for example, during video playback), use `"display"` rather than `"system"`. This helps save energy by allowing the rest of the system to enter sleep mode.

3. **Provide User Control**: Always offer users the ability to enable or disable wake locks. For example, if an extension prevents the system from sleeping during file downloads, provide an option for users to override this behavior.

4. **Inform Users About Power Management**: Make sure users are aware when a wake lock is active, as it can have a significant impact on battery life. Consider adding a visual indicator or notification when the system or display is being kept awake.

---

### **Potential Pitfalls**

- **Battery Drain**: Keeping the system or display awake for extended periods can quickly drain the battery, especially on laptops or mobile devices. Be mindful of this when designing your extension.
- **Forgetting to Release Wake Locks**: If you forget to release the wake lock, the system may remain awake indefinitely. This can frustrate users and lead to unnecessary power consumption.

- **Limited Use Cases**: The Power API is primarily useful in scenarios where the user is interacting with long-running tasks or visually active applications. For other types of extensions, its usefulness may be limited.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Power API provides a simple yet effective way for Chrome extensions to manage the systemâ€™s power state. By leveraging the API to prevent the system or display from sleeping when necessary, developers can create more responsive, user-friendly applications, particularly in scenarios involving video playback, file downloads, or real-time monitoring.
