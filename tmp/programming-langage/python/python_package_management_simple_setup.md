That's a great choice! Keeping your setup simple with just `pip3` and `Poetry` is an efficient way to manage your Python environments and dependencies, especially since you're already comfortable with the Homebrew-installed Python setup. Poetry will provide a more structured environment for managing dependencies and packaging your Python projects, while `pip3` will handle the rest for system-wide or global installations.

If you need further help integrating `Poetry` with your current workflow, feel free to ask!
