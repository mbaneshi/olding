To set up a Python environment management system on your Mac M1 that aligns with your current preferences and best practices, here's how you can proceed:

### 1. **Use `pyenv` for Python Version Management**

Since you’re familiar with managing Node.js via `pnpm`, `pyenv` is a good parallel for Python version management. It allows you to manage different Python versions locally and globally, much like you would with `nvm` for Node.js.

#### Steps:

1. Install `pyenv` via Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install pyenv
   ```

2. Configure Fish shell to integrate `pyenv`. Add the following to your `~/.config/fish/conf.d/index.fish` to ensure that `pyenv` initializes properly:

   ```fish
   set -x PYENV_ROOT "$HOME/.config/pyenv"
   set -x PATH "$PYENV_ROOT/bin" $PATH
   status --is-interactive; and . (pyenv init --path | psub)
   pyenv init - | source
   ```

3. Install Python versions using `pyenv`:
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.11.4  # Replace with the version you need
   pyenv global 3.11.4
   ```

### 2. **Use `pipx` for Global Python Package Management**

`pipx` installs and runs Python applications in isolated environments, avoiding the cluttering of your global Python environment with unnecessary dependencies. It’s great for managing command-line tools.

#### Steps:

1. Install `pipx`:

   ```bash
   brew install pipx
   ```

2. Ensure it runs in Fish:
   Add this to your `~/.config/fish/conf.d/index.fish`:

   ```fish
   set -xPIPX_HOME "$HOME/.config/pipx"
   pipx ensurepath
   ```

3. Install global CLI tools via `pipx`:
   ```bash
   pipx install black  # Example tool
   ```

### 3. **Use `Poetry` for Project Dependency Management**

For managing project-specific dependencies and virtual environments, `Poetry` is a great choice. It manages your `pyproject.toml` and creates isolated environments per project (similar to `pnpm`).

#### Steps:

1. Install `Poetry` via `pipx` to avoid global dependencies:

   ```bash
   pipx install poetry
   ```

2. Add configuration to Fish:

   ```fish
   set -xP POETRY_CONFIG_DIR "$HOME/.config/poetry"
   ```

3. Initialize a new Python project:
   ```bash
   poetry new my_project
   cd my_project
   poetry install
   ```

### 4. **Directory and Configuration Structure**

To keep everything under `~/.config`, here’s a sample structure for the tools:

```
~/.config/
  ├── fish/
  │   └── conf.d/
  │       └── index.fish
  ├── pyenv/
  ├── pipx/
  ├── poetry/
  └── python/  # For other general Python configuration
```

This setup ensures that everything (including binaries, tools, and configs) stays clean and organized.

---

**Summary:**

1. Install and configure `pyenv` for Python version management.
2. Use `pipx` for globally installed Python tools.
3. Use `Poetry` to manage project-specific dependencies and environments.
4. Keep all configurations under `~/.config/{your_tools_here}` and update your Fish shell to load them properly.
