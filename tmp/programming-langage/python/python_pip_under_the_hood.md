When you run `pip3 install <package>`, several processes occur under the hood. Let's break it down:

### 1. **Dependency Resolution and Index Search**:

- Pip queries the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) or a custom repository for the package.
- Pip resolves dependencies by examining the package's metadata. If dependencies are not met, it recursively checks and installs them.
- If `pip` is running behind a proxy, it will respect environment variables like `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`, which are used to configure proxy behavior.

### 2. **Download and Build**:

- If the package has precompiled binaries (called _wheels_, `.whl`), pip downloads and installs them directly.
- If binaries arenâ€™t available or a platform-specific build is needed, pip fetches the source distribution (a `.tar.gz` file) and compiles it. This may involve building C extensions or other native components.
- Python uses `setuptools` or `distutils` to handle package installation if a build is required.

### 3. **Installing Packages**:

- The installation process places the package into a directory within your Python environment, typically under `site-packages`.
- Pip also ensures that the package's dependencies are present and correct, updating or installing missing ones.
- Executable scripts are linked into appropriate directories like `/usr/local/bin` or within a virtual environment if you are using one.

### 4. **Module Resolution**:

- Once installed, Python's `import` system can locate the package by searching directories listed in `sys.path`.
- When you run `import <package>`, Python checks each directory in `sys.path` until it finds the package or raises a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### 5. **Proxy and Environment Settings**:

- Pip respects system-level proxy settings through environment variables:
  - `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`: Define proxy URLs for HTTP and HTTPS requests.
  - `NO_PROXY`: Specifies URLs that bypass the proxy.
- If pip needs to fetch packages behind a proxy, it relies on these environment variables. You can set them manually or through your shell configuration.
- You can also pass proxy options directly using pip flags like `--proxy`.

### 6. **Virtual Environments** (optional but recommended):

- If you are in a virtual environment (via `venv` or `virtualenv`), pip installs packages in the environment's isolated directory, leaving your global Python setup untouched.

By inspecting how pip behaves during installations and managing dependencies, you'll understand how it integrates with both Python and your system settings, including proxies.

To get further insights, you can also use pip commands like:

- `pip3 install -v <package>` (verbose mode, showing more detailed steps).
- `pip3 install --proxy <proxy-url>` (manual proxy override).
