To adhere to Python environment best practices while considering your setup and preferences, here's how you can proceed:

### 1. **Single Python Version (Homebrew Managed)**

You already have Python 3 installed through Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`), and you're satisfied with it, so no need for multiple versions or `pyenv`. Regularly updating via Homebrew works well.

### 2. **Virtual Environment Management**

To manage Python dependencies for individual projects while minimizing disk space usage (similar to `pnpm` in Node.js), you can use **`venv`** and place the environments in a central location. Here's a streamlined approach:

- **Centralized Virtual Envs:**
  Set up a central directory for all Python virtual environments under your `~/.config` folder.

  ```fish
  # Set up central virtualenv directory
  set -Ux WORKON_HOME ~/.config/python_envs
  ```

  Then, create virtual environments for each project inside that folder.

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv ~/.config/python_envs/my_project_env
  ```

  This way, your virtual environments don't clutter your project folders and are centrally managed.

### 3. **Fish Shell Configuration**

For Fish shell, automate the activation of virtual environments by sourcing the correct environment when entering a project directory. Add a snippet to `~/.config/fish/conf.d/python_env.fish`:

```fish
function auto_activate_venv
  if test -f .venv/bin/activate.fish
    source .venv/bin/activate.fish
  else if test -f ~/.config/python_envs/(basename (pwd))/bin/activate.fish
    source ~/.config/python_envs/(basename (pwd))/bin/activate.fish
  end
end

function cd
  builtin cd $argv
  auto_activate_venv
end
```

This will automatically activate a virtual environment when you navigate to a project directory that has a corresponding environment in `~/.config/python_envs`.

### 4. **Package Management and Disk Usage Optimization**

For disk space efficiency:

- **Minimize global installs** and use `pipx` for isolated global tools like `black`, `mypy`, etc.

  ```bash
  brew install pipx
  pipx install black
  ```

- Use **`--no-cache-dir`** when installing Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip3 install --no-cache-dir <package_name>
  ```

### 5. **Global Configuration for Python**

Since you like keeping configurations organized, you can set Python-related configurations in `~/.config/python` and use the `PYTHONUSERBASE` variable to redirect user-level Python package installations there:

```fish
set -Ux PYTHONUSERBASE ~/.config/python
```

This will ensure all Python-related data stays under `~/.config`.

This setup ensures centralized and efficient Python environment management, aligns with your Fish shell workflow, and keeps your Macâ€™s space optimized.
