To achieve a seamless Python setup on your Mac M1, with configurations centralized in `~/.config/{your_tools_here}`, and ensuring you don’t need to re-download Python modules for every project, here's an efficient, streamlined approach:

### 1. **Centralized Python Module Directory**

Instead of creating a virtual environment per project, use a shared Python module directory for all your projects. This avoids redundancy in downloading the same modules multiple times.

- Set up a **global shared directory** for Python modules. You can configure **`pip`** to install packages into a specific directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.config/python_modules
  ```
- Configure `pip` to use this directory for global installations by editing or creating a `pip` configuration file in `~/.config/pip/pip.conf`:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.config/pip
  nvim ~/.config/pip/pip.conf
  ```
  Add the following:
  ```ini
  [global]
  target = ~/.config/python_modules
  ```
- This ensures every Python package you install with `pip` will be installed in `~/.config/python_modules`.

### 2. **Managing Configurations in `~/.config`**

Store all tool configurations under `~/.config/{your_tools_here}` for consistency and simplicity. Examples include `pip`, `pyenv`, and Neovim configurations:

- **`pip`** configuration:
  - Already set with `pip.conf` in `~/.config/pip`.
- **`pyenv`** configuration (for Python versions):
  - If you want to manage global Python versions via `pyenv`, ensure the configuration is minimal. Add this to your `~/.config/pyenv/config` and export it in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
    ```bash
    set -x PYENV_ROOT "$HOME/.config/pyenv"
    set -x PATH "$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
    eval (pyenv init --path)
    eval (pyenv init -)
    ```

### 3. **Simplified Virtual Environment Setup**

If you need virtual environments but don't want them tied to specific projects:

- Create a **global virtual environment** that all projects can share, stored in `~/.config`:
  ```bash
  python -m venv ~/.config/global_venv
  ```
- Add this virtual environment to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to activate it globally on startup:
  ```bash
  source ~/.config/global_venv/bin/activate.fish
  ```
- Now, any new project you start will use this global virtual environment, and packages will be installed once across all projects.

### 4. **Managing Python Tools in `~/.config`**

You can set up any additional Python tools in `~/.config` to keep everything well-organized:

- For tools like **`poetry`**, set the configuration directory to reside in `~/.config`:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.config/poetry
  poetry config cache-dir ~/.config/poetry/cache
  poetry config virtualenvs.path ~/.config/poetry/venvs
  ```

### 5. **Automatic Proxy Configuration**

Store your proxy settings in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` so they apply globally and automatically:

```fish
set -x http_proxy http://your_http_proxy:port
set -x https_proxy https://your_https_proxy:port
set -x all_proxy socks5://your_socks_proxy:1080
```

### 6. **Final Directory Structure**

Here's what your `~/.config` structure could look like for Python development:

```
~/.config/
├── fish/
│   └── config.fish  # Shell config including proxy and global env setup
├── pip/
│   └── pip.conf  # Custom pip configuration for shared module directory
├── poetry/
│   ├── cache/    # Poetry cache directory
│   └── venvs/    # Poetry virtual environments
├── python_modules/  # Shared Python modules
└── global_venv/     # Global Python virtual environment
```

### 7. **Workflow**

- Now, every project you start will use the shared Python modules in `~/.config/python_modules`.
- If you ever need project-specific dependencies, you can still create a `venv` in the project itself or use the shared global virtual environment stored in `~/.config/global_venv`.

This setup ensures a minimalistic, centralized, and organized development environment that doesn’t require constant re-downloading of packages and keeps all configurations in `~/.config`.
