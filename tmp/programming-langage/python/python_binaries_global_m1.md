To make a Python binary available globally on your system from a Homebrew-managed Python installation, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Install the Binary Using Pip**:

- Many Python packages include command-line tools or binaries, which get installed in a directory typically linked to your PATH. For example:

```bash
pip3 install <package_with_binary>
```

### 2. **Find the Binary Path**:

After installation, Python binaries are usually placed in a specific directory. For Homebrew-installed Python, binaries from packages are typically located in:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/
```

### 3. **Add the Binary to Your PATH**:

To ensure the binary is accessible from any terminal or shell session, you need to add the installation path (if it's not already there) to your `PATH` environment variable. Here's how:

#### Mac M1 Shell Setup:

- **For Fish Shell (which you're using)**:

  ```bash
  set -Ux PATH /opt/homebrew/bin $PATH
  ```

  This command adds the Homebrew bin directory to your PATH for all future Fish shell sessions.

- **For Bash or Zsh**:
  Add the following line to your `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` (depending on your shell):
  ```bash
  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
  ```
  Then, source the file to apply the changes:
  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
  ```

### 4. **Verify the Binary Is Globally Available**:

Once you add the correct path, verify that the binary is available from any location by typing:

```bash
which <binary_name>
```

If it's set up correctly, it will point to `/opt/homebrew/bin/<binary_name>`.

### Example:

If you installed a package like `flake8` for linting, it would place the binary in `/opt/homebrew/bin/flake8`. Adding this path to your `PATH` ensures that you can run `flake8` from any directory in your terminal.

### Recap:

1. Install the Python package using `pip3`.
2. Add the binary path (`/opt/homebrew/bin/`) to your shell's `PATH` variable.
3. Ensure global access by verifying with the `which` command.
