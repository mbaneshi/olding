To achieve the same goal using Playwright instead of Puppeteer, you can follow a similar approach. Playwright is a powerful browser automation tool that supports multiple browsers and provides APIs for extracting the DOM and interacting with web pages.

### Step-by-Step Guide with Playwright

1. **Install Playwright**:
   Playwright is available as an npm package. You can install it via the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install playwright
   ```

2. **Extract DOM using Playwright**:
   Here's a script to navigate to `https://chatgpt.com/`, extract the DOM content, and save it to a file.

   ```js
   const { chromium } = require('playwright');
   const fs = require('fs');

   (async () => {
     // Launch a headless browser
     const browser = await chromium.launch();
     const page = await browser.newPage();

     // Navigate to the target URL
     await page.goto('https://chatgpt.com/');

     // Extract the DOM content
     const domContent = await page.content();

     // Save the content to an HTML file
     fs.writeFileSync('extractedDomPlaywright.html', domContent);

     console.log('DOM content saved to extractedDomPlaywright.html');

     // Close the browser
     await browser.close();
   })();
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Once the script is written, you can run it using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node extract_dom_playwright.js
   ```

   This script will create a file called `extractedDomPlaywright.html` containing the entire DOM of the webpage at `https://chatgpt.com/`.

4. **Visualize the Extracted DOM**:
   - Open the `extractedDomPlaywright.html` file in your browser.
   - Use the browserâ€™s DevTools (right-click > Inspect) to view the parsed DOM, making it easier to visually inspect and manipulate.

### Tools Overview

- **Playwright**: A Node.js library to automate browsers, supporting Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **fs**: A Node.js module for file operations to save the extracted content.
- **Browser DevTools**: Use these to inspect the HTML generated by Playwright.

This process will let you extract, save, and visually inspect the DOM content using Playwright in a more flexible, multi-browser-supported manner.
