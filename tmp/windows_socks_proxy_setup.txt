To set up a SOCKS5 proxy from your server with root SSH access and connect it to your Windows 10 machine, you can use SSH tunneling. This method allows you to establish a proxy connection easily without any additional software installation on the server. Here’s a simple and easy approach:

### Steps:

#### 1. **Set Up SSH Tunnel for SOCKS5 Proxy**  
You can use SSH to create a SOCKS5 proxy by connecting from your Windows machine to the server.

1. **Download and Install PuTTY**  
   - Download PuTTY from the official website: [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
   - Install it on your Windows machine.

2. **Configure PuTTY for the SOCKS5 Proxy**  
   Follow these steps to create an SSH tunnel using PuTTY:
   
   - Open **PuTTY** and enter the **IP address** or **domain** of your server in the "Host Name" field.
   
   - On the left side, under the **Category** panel, expand the **"Connection"** section and then expand **"SSH"**. Click on **Tunnels**.
   
   - In the "Source port" field, type `8080` (or any port you prefer).
   
   - Under "Destination", select the radio button that says **Dynamic**.
   
   - Choose **SOCKS5** as the proxy type.
   
   - Click the **Add** button.
   
   - Now go back to the **Session** section, and click **Open**. This will start an SSH session.

   - Login using your **root credentials** or SSH key, and the SOCKS5 proxy will be established.

#### 2. **Configure Windows to Use the SOCKS Proxy**

Once the SSH tunnel is set up, you need to configure your Windows system to use the proxy.

1. **Windows Network Settings (Optional Global Proxy Setup)**  
   If you want to route all your traffic through the SOCKS proxy, follow these steps:
   
   - Go to **Settings** -> **Network & Internet** -> **Proxy**.
   
   - Under "Manual proxy setup," toggle **Use a proxy server** to **On**.
   
   - In the **Address** field, type `127.0.0.1`.
   
   - In the **Port** field, type the same port you used in PuTTY (e.g., `8080`).

   - Save the changes, and now all your Windows applications will use this SOCKS5 proxy.

2. **Browser Configuration (Selective Use)**  
   If you only want to use the proxy for specific applications like a web browser, configure the browser settings:

   - For **Firefox**:  
     Open **Settings** -> **General** -> Scroll to **Network Settings** -> Click **Settings**.  
     Select **Manual Proxy Configuration**, enter `127.0.0.1` as the **SOCKS Host** and `8080` as the port.  
     Ensure **SOCKS5** is selected and check the **Proxy DNS when using SOCKS5** option.  
   
   - For **Chrome** (with an extension like **SwitchyOmega**):  
     Install the **SwitchyOmega** extension, and configure it to use `127.0.0.1:8080` as a SOCKS5 proxy.

#### 3. **Test the Proxy**

To verify that your SOCKS proxy is working:

- Use a browser to check your public IP address via websites like [https://whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com). It should show your server’s IP address instead of your Windows machine’s IP.

### Optional: Make the Proxy Available to All Apps Automatically (via Proxifier)

If you need to force all Windows applications to use the proxy without manual configuration, you can use software like **Proxifier**. This tool allows you to route all traffic through a SOCKS proxy easily.

1. Download and install **Proxifier**: [https://www.proxifier.com/](https://www.proxifier.com/).
2. Open **Proxifier**, go to **Profile** -> **Proxy Servers** -> **Add**.
3. Enter the IP as `127.0.0.1` and the port as `8080`.
4. Select **SOCKS5** and save.
5. Proxifier will now route all your traffic through the SOCKS5 proxy.
