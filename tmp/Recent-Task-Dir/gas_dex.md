## How dealing with Gas Articles :

### what improvements we can put there.
- Fift extensibility.
- shared library
- diverse instruction costs.
- sharding.
- who is responsible and send modes 

Now it is better to break things down into manageable components.

1) which file or directory or URLs should be opened for tasks.

* previous writted article for revisions and editing.
* tonkeeper w5 file.
* (lets brings light music in background - iranian light piano [choosed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS3LafxrMIs)) 
- 23:16 -still here.

- we stuck in proxy and Now time is 2024-01-17 23:46
36 Min , goes 

previous writted article was so nasty. I think I should rewrite it from scratch.
 
yes , now that we solve at least our schudles for DEX and TMA , it is suitable time to think about gas article differently.

let's start with outline :
What should be covered.

- instructions 
- send mode 
- shrding 
- error handling - it is related to mode as well.
- fift extensibility
- shared library

## Questions
1 - How fift reduce gas consumption?
2 - How Shared library works?
3 - How instruction orgnized in regards to gas consumptions and stack primitives and how they calculated.

## Resources for study

- instruction page 
- w5 tonkeeper 
- fift and stack in pdfs
- instruction sheets 
- devoted special directories for our recent task 

it is 2024-01-18 04:04 , not valuable results yet. just exploring some docs and no clear answer yet.
