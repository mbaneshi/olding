**Alternatives to Framer for Open Source Development**

If you prefer open-source tools that allow you to build upon their codebase and integrate them into your development environment, there are several alternatives to Framer that can meet your needs:

1. **Figma (via FigJam)**:
   - **Overview**: While Figma itself is not open source, FigJam, which is part of Figma, provides a collaborative whiteboarding environment. You can use its API for integration with local tools, but access to the full codebase is limited.
   - **Integration**: Figma has plugins and an API that can be used to create custom integrations. Although not open source, many community plugins are available.

2. **Penpot**:
   - **Overview**: An open-source design and prototyping platform, Penpot is designed for teams and allows you to create interactive designs. You can access its codebase on GitHub.
   - **Integration**: Being open source, you can modify it to suit your development needs and integrate it with your local APIs and automation tools.

3. **Lottie**:
   - **Overview**: Lottie is an open-source animation file format for lightweight animations. While not a full design tool, you can create animations in Adobe After Effects and export them as Lottie files.
   - **Integration**: You can use Lottie animations in web and mobile apps, allowing for high customization in development.

4. **Open Source Design Tools**:
   - **GIMP**: An open-source image editor similar to Photoshop, suitable for creating design assets.
   - **Inkscape**: An open-source vector graphics editor that can be used for designing scalable graphics.

5. **Sketch (with open-source plugins)**:
   - **Overview**: Sketch is not open source, but it has a vibrant community of plugins, some of which are open source.
   - **Integration**: You can customize Sketch with open-source plugins or use design systems and component libraries that integrate with your development workflow.

6. **Webflow**:
   - **Overview**: While Webflow is a commercial product, it allows you to export code (HTML, CSS, JS) from your designs, which you can integrate into your local projects.
   - **Integration**: It provides APIs for further integration, but you wonâ€™t have access to the source code.

7. **React with Storybook**:
   - **Overview**: If you're working primarily with React, you can use Storybook to create UI components in isolation.
   - **Integration**: Storybook is open source and allows you to build and test components with easy integration into your development workflow.

8. **Flutter**:
   - **Overview**: If you're open to mobile development, Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit that enables building natively compiled applications.
   - **Integration**: You can fully customize the UI and use Dart language features to integrate with APIs, making it a robust option for cross-platform applications.

By using these alternatives, you can have full control over the codebase, enabling you to customize the functionality to suit your needs while integrating with AI and your local development APIs.
