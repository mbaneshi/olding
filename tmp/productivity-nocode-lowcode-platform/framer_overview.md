**Overview of Framer**

Framer is a powerful design and prototyping tool that enables designers and developers to create interactive, high-fidelity prototypes for web and mobile applications. Launched initially as a tool for designers, Framer has evolved into a collaborative platform that bridges the gap between design and development. Here are the key features and components of Framer:

1. **Visual Design**: Framer offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that allows users to create layouts and designs visually, without needing extensive coding knowledge. Users can import design assets and manipulate them directly on the canvas.

2. **Interactive Prototyping**: One of Framer's standout features is its ability to create interactive prototypes. Designers can add animations, transitions, and interactive elements, allowing stakeholders to experience the design as if it were a live application.

3. **Code Integration**: While it caters to designers, Framer also supports code-based design. Users can write custom code using JavaScript or TypeScript to enhance prototypes with complex logic or integrations, making it a versatile tool for developers.

4. **Collaboration**: Framer facilitates collaboration among teams with features like comments, version history, and real-time editing. This ensures that all team members can contribute, give feedback, and stay aligned throughout the design process.

5. **Design Systems**: The platform supports design systems, allowing teams to create reusable components and maintain consistency across projects. This feature helps streamline the design process and improves collaboration between designers and developers.

6. **Publishing and Sharing**: Once a project is complete, Framer provides options to publish prototypes online, making it easy to share work with clients, stakeholders, or team members for review and feedback.

7. **Integration with Other Tools**: Framer can integrate with other popular design and development tools like Figma, Sketch, and various APIs, enhancing its usability within existing workflows.

Framer is particularly valuable for teams looking to create highly interactive designs and prototypes that require collaboration between design and development, making it an essential tool in modern design workflows.
