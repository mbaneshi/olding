From the output you provided, it appears that Google Chrome is running on your Mac, but the remote debugging port (`9222`) is not listening, as confirmed by the absence of any output from the `lsof -i :9222` command you executed earlier. Hereâ€™s how to troubleshoot this issue further:

### Steps to Enable Remote Debugging for Google Chrome

1. **Kill Any Existing Chrome Processes**:
   First, ensure that no Chrome instances are interfering with your debugging setup. Use the following command to terminate all Chrome processes:

   ```bash
   killall 'Google Chrome'
   ```

2. **Launch Chrome with Remote Debugging**:
   Now, launch Chrome again, making sure to specify the remote debugging port:

   ```bash
   /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug
   ```

   - **Note**: The `--user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug` option is included to ensure that a fresh user profile is used, preventing issues related to cached data or existing sessions.

3. **Check for Listening Ports**:
   After executing the command above, check again if Chrome is listening on port `9222`:

   ```bash
   lsof -i :9222
   ```

   You should see output indicating that Chrome is now listening on that port. If it is, proceed to the next step.

4. **Test the Remote Debugging**:
   In another terminal window, run the following command to access the debugging endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9222/json
   ```

   This should return a JSON array with information about the open tabs in Chrome.

5. **Use Playwright to Connect**:
   If the above steps are successful, you can now run your Playwright script. Replace `<id>` in the following command with the actual browser ID you received from the previous `curl` output:

   ```javascript
   const { chromium } = require('playwright');

   (async () => {
       const browser = await chromium.connect({
           wsEndpoint: 'http://localhost:9222/devtools/browser/<id>'
       });

       const context = await browser.newContext();
       const page = await context.newPage();
       await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

       // Your automation code here

       await browser.close();
   })();
   ```

### Additional Considerations

- **Firewall and Security Settings**: Make sure that no firewall or security settings on your Mac are blocking localhost connections.
  
- **Browser Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of Playwright you are using is compatible with your version of Google Chrome. You can update Playwright with the following command:

  ```bash
  npm install playwright
  ```

- **Check for Chrome Extensions**: If you are using any Chrome extensions, consider running Chrome in incognito mode (you can add `--incognito` flag) to prevent any extensions from causing issues.

- **MacOS Permissions**: Ensure that your terminal has permissions to control Chrome. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Automation** and check that your terminal app has access to Google Chrome.

### Conclusion

If you follow these steps and still can't connect to the remote debugging port, please provide any error messages or unexpected behaviors you encounter during this process. This will help in further diagnosing the issue.
