Let's go deeper into the **`-g` (global)**, **`-x` (exported/environment)**, and **`-U` (universal)** flags in the Fish shell, with clear use cases for each.

### 1. `-g` (Global Scope)

#### **What it does:**
The `-g` flag creates a **global** variable. Global variables are accessible from anywhere within the current Fish shell session, including within functions and scripts. However, once the Fish shell session ends, the global variable is lost.

#### **Use Case:**
Suppose you want to set a configuration variable that will be used throughout a single Fish shell session, such as a logging level or custom prompt format.

#### **Example:**

```fish
# Define a global variable for the log level
set -g LOG_LEVEL "DEBUG"

# A function that uses this global variable
function log_message
    echo "[$LOG_LEVEL] $argv"
end

# Call the function, it has access to the global variable
log_message "This is a debug message"
```

#### **Why use it?**
- Use global variables when you need them to be accessible in multiple functions or parts of a script but only for the **current session**.
- Great for storing temporary session-specific configurations.

### 2. `-x` (Exported/Environment Variable)

#### **What it does:**
The `-x` flag exports a variable as an **environment** variable, making it accessible to child processes spawned from the shell (like other programs or scripts). This is crucial when you want external programs (like `git` or `curl`) to have access to a specific value.

#### **Use Case:**
A common scenario is passing environment variables like API tokens or paths to external programs. For example, setting a GitHub token so that it's available to `curl` or `git`.

#### **Example:**

```fish
# Export a GitHub token so it's available to external commands
set -x GITHUB_TOKEN "your-github-token"

# Use curl to authenticate to the GitHub API using this token
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

#### **Why use it?**
- When you need a variable to be accessible outside the Fish shell environment (to programs like `curl`, `git`, or any other child processes).
- It is essential for sensitive information like tokens or paths that need to be passed into programs.

### 3. `-U` (Universal Variable)

#### **What it does:**
The `-U` flag sets a **universal** variable. Universal variables are special in Fish shell—they are shared across all Fish shell sessions (even in different terminals) and are persistent across shell restarts. They are stored in Fish’s configuration and are synced across sessions.

#### **Use Case:**
Use universal variables for settings or configurations that you want to apply **globally across all Fish sessions** and persist between shell restarts. This is ideal for things like frequently used paths, aliases, or even configurations for prompts.

#### **Example:**

```fish
# Set a universal variable for a custom prompt
set -U FISH_PROMPT_COLOR "cyan"

# Function that uses the universal variable in the prompt
function fish_prompt
    set_color $FISH_PROMPT_COLOR
    echo -n (whoami) '@' (hostname) ' > '
    set_color normal
end

# Open a new terminal or restart Fish, the custom prompt color persists
```

#### **Why use it?**
- When you want a variable to be **persistent across all Fish shell sessions**, even when you close and reopen your terminal.
- Ideal for configurations that are system-wide or that you always want to be available, like custom settings for prompts, default paths, or environment variables you always use.

---

### **Summary of Use Cases:**
- **`-g` (Global):** Useful when you need variables to persist throughout a single Fish session but don't need them outside of the session (e.g., temporary configuration during a script run).
- **`-x` (Exported/Environment):** Required when a variable must be passed to external programs and child processes (e.g., API tokens, paths for `git` or `curl`).
- **`-U` (Universal):** Perfect for variables that should be shared across all Fish shell instances and saved between terminal sessions (e.g., global configurations or settings like prompt colors or favorite directories).

Each of these options serves different needs based on scope and persistence.
