I am building an educational app using the following tech stack and components:

Streamlit and FastAPI for the admin panel
Express.js and Playwright for an automated agent
Google Chrome Extension for manual trend collection
Telegram API to archive trends to a Telegram channel
OpenAI API for data validation during the process
The purpose of the app is to scrape trending content from any site, validate it with AI, and archive the results on a Telegram channel. Please provide a detailed plan, design suggestions, and implementation steps while following SOLID principles.

Key Requirements:
Admin Panel (Streamlit + FastAPI) to manage and monitor tasks
Automated Scraping Agent using Playwright, integrated with Express.js
Google Chrome Extension to allow users to trigger scraping manually
Telegram Integration to push validated data to a specific channel
AI Layer using OpenAI API for content validation
Deployment Plan with recommendations for PM2, Heroku, or any suitable platforms
Examples of Code Snippets for critical areas (admin panel, scraping, Telegram bot, AI validation)
Ensure the design adheres to SOLID principles, making it easy to extend, test, and maintain.
Deliverables:
A complete architectural plan for the project
Design strategies to implement efficient communication between components (e.g., agent -> admin -> Telegram)
Sample code snippets for key functionalities
Suggested tools or best practices for scheduling scraping and monitoring via the admin panel
Deployment strategies for a smooth rollout
Please provide your response in a way that helps me efficiently implement each phase of the app, and if needed, guide me to relevant libraries or frameworks to achieve the desired functionality.

## Detailed Architectural Plan

### 1. **Overview of the Components and their Responsibilities**
- **Admin Panel (Streamlit + FastAPI):**  
  Manage scraping tasks, monitor logs, and provide real-time feedback.
  
- **Automated Agent (Playwright + Express.js):**  
  Execute scraping tasks automatically, with Express.js acting as a microservice to manage the agent.

- **Google Chrome Extension:**  
  Enable manual trend collection by triggering scraping from the browser.

- **Telegram Integration:**  
  Archive validated trends directly to a Telegram channel.

- **AI Validation (OpenAI API):**  
  Validate scraped data and ensure content quality.

---

## 2. **Design Strategies following SOLID Principles**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - Keep each component focused on a specific task.  
     - **Admin Panel:** UI and management.
     - **Agent:** Scraping logic.
     - **Telegram Integration:** Archiving data only.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Ensure the scraping agent and AI validation logic can easily extend to new sites or AI models without modifying core classes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - For scraping logic, create a base scraper class and derive different site-specific scrapers from it.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Separate interfaces for scraping, validation, and Telegram archiving to ensure components only depend on relevant methods.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - Use abstractions for communication between components.  
     - Example: Implement a **publisher-subscriber** model for communication between the scraping agent and admin panel.

---

## 3. **Component Communication Strategy**

### **High-Level Flow:**
1. **User triggers scraping** (via Admin Panel or Chrome Extension).
2. **Scraping Agent** collects data and sends results to **FastAPI** via HTTP requests.
3. **FastAPI** sends the data to **OpenAI API** for validation.
4. Once validated, data is forwarded to the **Telegram Bot API** for archiving.
5. **Admin Panel** monitors scraping logs and allows task management.

### **Communication Between Components:**
- **Express.js ↔ FastAPI:** Use **HTTP requests** or **WebSockets** for real-time data transfer.
- **Admin Panel ↔ FastAPI:** Use **RESTful API** calls.
- **FastAPI ↔ OpenAI API / Telegram API:** Use **external API calls** for validation and archiving.

## 4. **Code Snippets**

### 1. **Admin Panel (Streamlit + FastAPI)**
```python
# FastAPI server to manage scraping tasks
from fastapi import FastAPI
import requests

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/trigger-scraping")
def trigger_scraping(url: str):
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:3000/scrape", json={"url": url})
    return {"status": response.status_code, "message": "Scraping triggered"}

# Streamlit UI for Admin Panel
import streamlit as st

st.title("Admin Panel - Scraping Manager")

if st.button("Start Scraping"):
    url = st.text_input("Enter URL to scrape")
    if url:
        res = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/trigger-scraping", json={"url": url})
        st.write(res.json())
```

### 2. **Automated Agent (Playwright + Express.js)**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/scrape', async (req, res) => {
    const url = req.body.url;
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(url);

    const content = await page.content();
    await browser.close();
    res.json({ content });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Scraping Agent running on port 3000'));
```

### 3. **Telegram Bot Integration**
```python
import requests

TELEGRAM_API_URL = f"https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_token>/sendMessage"

def send_to_telegram(chat_id, message):
    response = requests.post(TELEGRAM_API_URL, json={"chat_id": chat_id, "text": message})
    return response.json()
```

### 4. **AI Validation using OpenAI API**
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

def validate_content(content):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Validate the following content: {content}",
        max_tokens=50
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

---

## 5. **Scheduling and Monitoring**

1. **Scheduling Scraping Tasks:**  
   Use **`cron` jobs** or **`APScheduler`** in Python to automate scraping at regular intervals.

2. **Monitoring via Admin Panel:**  
   Implement **logging middleware** in Express.js to send logs to FastAPI, which can be displayed in Streamlit.

---

## 6. **Deployment Strategies**

1. **Express.js and Playwright Agent:**  
   - Use **PM2** to keep the Express.js microservice running reliably.  
     ```bash
     pm2 start index.js --name scraping-agent
     ```

2. **FastAPI Server:**  
   - Deploy on **Heroku** or **Render** for easy setup. Use **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server.
     ```bash
     gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app
     ```

3. **Chrome Extension:**  
   - Distribute via the **Chrome Web Store**. Use **background scripts** to trigger scraping.

4. **Telegram Bot:**  
   - Ensure the bot runs 24/7 on **Heroku** or **Replit**.

---

## 7. **Tools and Libraries Recommendations**

1. **PM2** for process management (Express.js).
2. **Uvicorn + Gunicorn** for FastAPI server.
3. **APScheduler** or **Celery** for scheduling tasks.
4. **dotenv** library for managing environment variables securely.
5. **Sentry** for monitoring and error tracking across components.

---

## 8. **Final Recommendations for Smooth Implementation**

- **Incremental Development:**  
  Build and deploy each component separately to identify bottlenecks early.

- **Testing:**  
  Use **Jest** for testing the Express.js microservice and **Pytest** for testing the FastAPI logic.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Implement centralized error-handling middleware in Express.js and FastAPI to ensure smooth communication.
